After it began streaming on Netflix, the series blew up — even earning Emmys for its last season. Speaking of that final outing, the show’s finale found itself with some detractors.

But, ultimately, the show and the cast had a phenomenal run. The series finale, appropriately titled “Happy Ending,” saw the Rose family completing their journeys and leaving the titular town behind.</p><p id=par-3_47>The emotional episode revolved around David (<a href=#>Dan Levy</a>) and Patrick’s (Noah Reid) wedding. Despite terrible weather and Alexis (Murphy) wearing a bride’s gown to her brother’s wedding, the sentimental ceremony seemed like the perfect way to cap off the heartwarming TV series so many grew to love.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-4_42>After much celebrating, with Alexis heading to New York and Moira (Catherine O’Hara) and Johnny (<a href=#>Levy’s actual father, Eugene Levy</a>) returning to California, the Rose family say goodbye to one another and the town that begrudgingly became a beloved home for them.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-5_21>The episode was a total tearjerker and seemed to perfectly capture the characters and their stories. So why wasn’t Murphy happy?</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-annie-murphy-wanted-a-schitt-s-creek-double-wedding>Annie Murphy wanted a ‘Schitt’s Creek’ double wedding</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/schitts-creek-finale.jpg><p id=par-6_44>Speaking to <a href=#>EW</a>, co-creator and star Dan Levy revealed the original plan for the <a href=#>Schitt’s Creek series finale</a>. “I thought Alexis and Ted were going to be the wedding at the end of the series — and then I foolishly told Annie,” he said.</p><p id=par-7_67>“Dan was like, ‘There’s going to be a double wedding. It’s going to be Ted and Alexis and Patrick and David,'” shared Murphy. “I was like, ‘Yay, I can’t wait! Sign me up. That’s going to be a perfect ending to the show.'” The actor says she “was furious,” it didn’t happen. “I threatened to quit the show — and didn’t follow through on it,” she noted.</p><p id=par-8_23>So what happened? Ultimately, Alexis and Ted breaking up so they could each live their own career dreams was the better arc.</p><p id=par-9_61>“Alexis needed to come out of this show liberated in a way that wasn’t necessarily attached to a guy,” Levy explained. “I felt like it would be more fulfilling to that character to have loved and lost and been set on a track that is leading her into her future rather than settle with someone at the end of the show.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-schitt-s-creek-received-a-lot-of-praise-for-its-ending>‘Schitt’s Creek’ received a lot of praise for its ending</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p></figure><p id=par-10_45>The series delivered an ending that made its humor and heartfelt moments all worth it. Each character got what they needed, tying the show up perfectly. To top it off, the cast was rewarded thoroughly, with the show sweeping the comedy category at the Emmys.</p><p id=par-11_64>Many were surprised Dan Levy chose to end the show where he did, <a href=#>given its late success</a>. “For me, this was never going to be one of the 10 to 12-season shows,” he told <a href=#>GoldDerby</a>. “This was always going to be small. The minute that I felt like we even had the potential of overstaying our welcome was the time that we should go.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGTApLTIrausZZOnsqa3jKyrmqpdo7KivsuyZKqtmal6tLTOsGSorpWneqe1zZqjnmaYqbqtew%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-richest-person-in-denmark-has-6-7-billion-thanks-to-legos.html><span>←</span><span>The Richest Person In Denmark Has $6.7 Billion Thanks To LEGOs</span></a>
