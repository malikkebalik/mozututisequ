Though the <a href=#>PBS</a> series has been <a href=#>renewed for season 3</a>, new episodes won’t air until 2023.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-2_54>Fortunately, there’s no shortage of shows that offer some of the same charm and romance as Sanditon. You’re probably familiar with Netflix’s Bridgerton and the classic <a href=#>1995 Pride & Prejudice with Colin Firth</a>. But that’s just the tip of the iceberg. These 10 series will also transport you to a world similar to Sanditon.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>‘Death Comes to Pemberley’&nbsp;</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-1><p></p></figure><p id=par-3_90>Like Sanditon, Death Comes to Pemberley is another show that takes <a href=#>characters created by Jane Austen</a> and imagines its own story for them. This three-episode miniseries is based on a mystery novel by P.D. James that takes place after the events of Pride & Prejudice. In the series, Elizabeth (Anna Maxwell Martin) and Mr. Darcy (Matthew Rhys) are preparing for a ball at Pemberley. When the roguish and untrustworthy Wickham (Matthew Goode) and his wife Lydia (Jenna Coleman) make an unwelcome reappearance, they drag the Darcys into a murder investigation.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-4_9>Streaming on the PBS Masterpiece channel on Prime Video.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>‘Beecham House’</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/BeechamHouse_FirstLook1_FINAL.jpg><p id=par-5_83>Sanditon fans who missed Leo Suter’s presence in season 2 will want to check out Beecham House, a six-episode historical drama set in 19th-century India. Suter plays Daniel Beecham, the brother of John Beecham (Tom Bateman), a former British soldier with a mysterious past who moves into a vast mansion in Delhi with his servants and family. One caveat: Like the first season of Sanditon, <a href=#>Beecham House ends on a major cliffhanger</a>, and the show has not been renewed for a second season.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-6_14>One season streaming on PBS Masterpiece channel on Prime Video and on PBS Passport.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>‘Jane Eyre’</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p></figure><p id=par-7_59>We don’t think he’s keeping a mad wife in the attic, but Alexander Colbourne (Ben Lloyd-Hughes) was still giving us serious Mr. Rochester vibes in Sanditon Season 2. Revisit the original story of an orphaned governess falling for her brooding employer in this 2006 miniseries adaptation of Jane Eyre. Ruth Wilson plays Jane and Toby Stephens plays Mr. Rochester.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-8_6>Streaming on Hulu and HBO Max.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>‘Little Dorrit’&nbsp;</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-4><p></p></figure><p id=par-9_64>Andrew Davies – who created Sanditon Season 1 – is also behind this adaptation of Charles Dickens’ classic novel. Set in the 1820s, it follows Amy Dorrit (Claire Foy) who has lived all her life in a debtors’ prison with her father (Tom Courtenay). While working as a seamstress, she meets Arthur Clenman (Matthew Macfadyen), whose family history is tied up with her own.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p id=par-10_6>Streaming on Britbox and Pluto TV.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>‘Poldark’&nbsp;</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Poldark5_EP1_1.jpg><p id=par-11_90>It’s 1783, and Ross Poldark (Aidan Turner) returns home to Cornwall after fighting in America’s War of Independence. He discovers the woman he loves engaged to another man and his family’s estate in ruins. Over five seasons, the impulsive, principled, and <a href=#>often-infuriating Ross</a> works to rebuild his life and fortunes and make a better life for his tenants and employees while also finding new love with his maid, Demelza (Eleanor Tomlinson). Poldark has its share of dark moments, but there’s also plenty of romance, which should appeal to Sanditon fans.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-12_6>Five seasons streaming on Prime Video</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>‘Cranford’&nbsp;</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-6><p></p></figure><p id=par-13_55>For another tale of small-town life with a rich cast of characters, look no further than Cranford.
