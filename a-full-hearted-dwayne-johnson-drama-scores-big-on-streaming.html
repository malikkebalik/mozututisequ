Recommended Videos Directed by Phil Joanou, Johnson stars as Coach Sean Porter — a no-nonsense worker at a juvenile detention camp who, after fearing for the future lives of the boys in the juvenile system, begins a football program at the center to keep the boys out of trouble and to implement team-oriented skill sets and discipline."><meta name=author content="Aldo Pusey"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

But, before Johnson was fully bathed in his influential big-movie stardom, his leading role in sports drama <strong>Gridiron Gang </strong>uncovered the world of heartfelt football and showcased some of Johnson’s best work.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=551 data-current-count=551 data-injectable=true>Directed by Phil Joanou, Johnson stars as Coach Sean Porter — a no-nonsense worker at a juvenile detention camp who, after fearing for the future lives of the boys in the juvenile system, begins a football program at the center to keep the boys out of trouble and to implement team-oriented skill sets and discipline. The film is loosely based on the real-life story of the Kilpatrick Mustangs in Los Angeles County back in the ‘90s. Alongside Johnson are&nbsp;Xzibit, L. Scott Caldwell, and Kevin Dunn, who all deliver unforgettable performances.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/gridiron-gang-movie.png><p data-characters=359 data-current-count=659 data-injectable=true>But, even with the movie’s strong push for a heart-warming feel and positive affirmation from the coaches, stone-faced critics weren’t impressed with the “cliche execution” of the film. As it stands, Gridiron Gang currently holds a measly 42% score on Rotten Tomatoes, despite having one of the biggest money-making stars in the world as its lead.</p><p data-characters=357 data-current-count=357 data-injectable=false>Critics be damned however, as eagle-eyed Netflix subscribers decided to give the Dwayne Johnson vehicle a second chance — and awarded it with a newfound life on the streaming charts. As per <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">FlixPatrol</a>, Gridiron Gang has jumped a considerable number of spaces to crack into Netflix’s most-watched movies, and it doesn’t appear as if it will stop there.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeemsS0e8Bmna6knGK1pq3RrZydZZSsrrq6xGahqKCeqLyvecOrmKaZXaiwsL7ErGSboZdivK950q2pnpmdnruoew%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./trent-richardson-s-friends-and-family-spent-over-1-6-million-of-his-money.html><span>←</span><span>Trent Richardson's Friends And Family Spent Over $1.6 Million Of His Money!</span></a>
