As a result, the Republic of Gilead was formed. This society, which is located in the present-day United States, treated women as properties of the state.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-3_39>Some fertile women were assigned as “handmaids” to high-ranking officials in an effort to increase the number of children and reward these “commanders” for their service. With this new country came plenty of new phrases used by the citizens.</p><p id=par-4_34>One of the most common phrases was “blessed be the fruit,” a greeting used by handmaids that was said to encourage fertility. The proper response to this phrase would be “May the Lord open.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-under-his-eye>’Under His Eye’</h2><p id=par-5_38>Another biblical reference, this phrase is used to say hello or goodbye by citizens in the Republic of Gilead. Additionally, some interpret this phrase to mean that the “eyes” (or the secret police of Gilead) are always watching.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-6_26>An alternative greeting would be to say “blessed evening” or “blessed day,” instead of phrases used in the United States — “good morning” or “good night.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-we-ve-been-sent-good-weather>‘We’ve been sent good weather’</h2><p id=par-7_45>The Handmaids of these series are allowed very few freedoms. They are, however, allowed to travel to stores like All Flesh and Milk and Honey. They are also allowed to speak select phrases to each other. One of those is, “We’ve been sent good weather.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-4><p></p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-there-are-other-words-used-in-the-handmaid-s-tale-including-particicution>There are other words used in ‘The Handmaid’s Tale,’ including ‘Particicution’</h2><p id=par-8_35>The “eyes,” or secret police of this country, are always watching. Even some of the Handmaids are known to turn in traitors to Gilead. As a result, there are a few forms of punishment administered.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-9_45>That includes “particicution,” which is when the Handmaids, dressed in <a href=#>their red cloaks</a>, have free reign to do whatever they want to a rebel. It typically ends in death by beating. There is also “the wall,” where Gilead hung traitors as an example to others.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-10_44>Even the words used to describe the careers in Gilead are inspired by religion. The “Marthas” are household servants assigned to people of power. The name comes from one of Jesus’ friends who, according to <a href=#>Refinery29</a>, “is a pragmatic and focused on domestic concerns.”</p><p id=par-11_33>The Rachel and Leah Center, also known as the Red Center, is where the Handmaids are trained for their new postings. This location was named after the biblical story of Rachel and Leah.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-12_19>Seasons 1-3 of <a href=#>The Handmaid’s Tale</a> are available for streaming on Hulu, as are select episodes of season 4.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGSvrbHSrJydZZanwqrAjKCsopyVYr2pvsCsnKxlpaiypXnHmqWdpZGesbR505qjnmaYqbqtew%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-justin-kroma-dating-justin-kroma-s-girlfriend-exes.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Justin Kroma Dating Justin Kroma's Girlfriend &amp;amp; Exes</span></a>
