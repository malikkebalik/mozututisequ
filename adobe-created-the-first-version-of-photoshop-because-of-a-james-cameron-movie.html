Knoll, a doctoral candidate, wrote a program that could project grayscale images on a black-white bitmap monitor. The program, Display, was something Knoll whipped up while on a break from developing his doctoral thesis.</span></p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-248650 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/GettyImages-904630136.jpg alt width=900 height=646 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-248650 class=wp-caption-text>Tommaso Boddi/Getty Images for AMC</p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Knoll thought his program was just a fun distraction and didn't put too much stock into it. He did show his brother John, though, who worked at Industrial Light and Magic, a special effects studio.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>The brothers used Display as the foundation for a new special effects program while making </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>The Abyss</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>. After the program was further developed and refined, it was demoed to Adobe in 1988.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Adobe was immediately impressed by Display. Just two years later, the company published the first edition of Photoshop, which is now the most popular photo-editing program on the market.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>And to think, it all happened thanks to a guy who was fiddling around with his computer while bored.
