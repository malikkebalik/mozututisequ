Donato will lead Bowery's efforts to scale up, Bloomberg's Olivia Zaleski <a href=# data-analytics-product-module=body_link rel=nofollow>reports</a>.</p><p>At Amazon, Donato ran Amazon Home Services, which matches cleaners, plumbers, and more with homeowners. Before that, he managed Amazon's distribution centers (where robots and humans compile orders for delivery), and&nbsp;<span>Amazon Fresh and Pantry food-delivery services.</span></p><p><span>In many ways, Donato's new role will mirror his responsibilities at Amazon. Since Bowery's inception nearly two years ago, the startup has focused heavily on automating most of the growing and harvesting process.&nbsp;Unlike traditional outdoor farms, <a href=# data-analytics-product-module=body_link rel>Bowery grows greens under LEDs</a> (which mimic natural sunlight) inside a giant warehouse in Kearny, New Jersey. Instead of soil, crops sprout in nutrient-rich water beds on trays stacked from the floor to the ceiling. Sensors in the trays track how the plants are doing in real time.</span></p><p><span>In June 2017, <a href=# data-analytics-product-module=body_link rel>Bowery&nbsp;raised $20 million</a> in Series A funding, co-led by General Catalyst and GGV Capital ​with participation​ from GV (formerly Google Ventures). Co-founder Irving Fain previously <a href=# data-analytics-product-module=body_link rel>told</a> Business Insider that the company will use the funding to build more farms (first in the New York metropolitan area and later in other cities across the US), move beyond greens to other crops, and hire more people.</span></p><p>Advertisement</p><p><span>Bowery is currently testing over 80 different varieties of greens, including baby kale, mustard greens, and arugula.&nbsp;Out of those 80, Bowery is selling six types at&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-product-module=body_link rel=nofollow>select Whole Foods&nbsp;</a>and Foragers stores in the tri-state area. A five-ounce package costs $3.99, which is about the price of most organic greens.</span></p><p><span>Like most vertical farming startups, Bowery has been largely dependent on venture capital to build and operate its farms.</span></p><p><span>Others projects haven't been as successful.&nbsp;</span><span><a href=# data-analytics-product-module=body_link rel=nofollow>Panasonic</a> and Google have abandoned vertical farming projects, and in 2017,&nbsp;FarmedHere — once the largest vertical farm in the US — <a href=# data-analytics-product-module=body_link rel=nofollow>shut down</a>.</span></p><p><span>The nearly decade-old indoor farming industry has faced several challenges, especially around energy costs and scalability — making it harder to compete in regions where cheap vegetables are abundant. According to <a href=# data-analytics-product-module=body_link rel=nofollow>a recent analysis</a> from Civil Eats, a 30,000-square-foot vertical farm in metro New York City spends around $216,000 annually for electricity and another $120,000 on HVAC systems.&nbsp;</span><span>If the industry can manage to expand, find a more energy-efficient alternative to LEDs, and automate more of the human labor, those operational costs may decline.</span></p><p>Advertisement</p><p><span>Bowery Farm is now working on its next farm in the New York metropolitan area . In the future, Fain said he hopes to expand internationally.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o8HSoqWeq6Oeu7S1w56pZ5ufonyiucCzpqdlkqe2orqMnaanmaSkerex0a2gnJmcYrOivsyipaBlo6mus8DUqWSbp6eav7p5kWlocWVn</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./adam-busby-gives-an-update-on-hazel-busby-s-eyes.html><span>←</span><span>Adam Busby Gives an Update on Hazel Busby's Eyes</span></a>
