Instead of bringing back the military style, he introduced a more mature and heart-fluttering look in the Euphoria series with his simple buzz cut, clean sides, and beard.</p><h2>Early Days and Education</h2><p>Cloud was born in Oakland and spent his childhood there with his family and siblings. Although the name of the parents is not known, sources claim his parents were professors.</p><p>From the beginning, there was an academics environment in the family.
