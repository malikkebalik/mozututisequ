Celebrity</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>No, there were no shark attacks, because sharks actually don’t like water that is extremely cold. For example, water that has a temperature below freezing, as it was the night that Titanic sank.</p><p>/ ﻿ 41.72556°N 49.94694°W ﻿ / 41.72556; -49.94694 The RMS Titanic sank in the early morning hours of 15 April 1912 in the North Atlantic Ocean, four days into her maiden voyage from Southampton to New York City.</p><p>Her sinking two hours and forty minutes later at 02:20 (ship’s time; 05:18 GMT) on Monday, 15 April, resulted in the deaths of more than 1,500 people, making it one of the deadliest peacetime maritime disasters in history. Titanic received six warnings of sea ice on 14 April but was travelling about 22 knots when her lookouts sighted the iceberg.</p><p>There were no fish or sharks because they were not relevant for the event (first and only guess), and as discussed in some answers. Now, there is life in the North Atlantic and all the way up to the Arctic Ocean.</p><h2>How deep is the ocean floor after 105 years?</h2><p>To summarize from all the answers over time: After 105 years on the ocean floor in water<strong> 2 1/2 miles</strong> deep she would not be able to withstand the stresses from being connected to the surface, let alone being pulled up there. There is a very large, well distributed debris field surrounding the. Continue Reading.</p><p><strong>Sharks vary quite a bit between species. If there were sharks present, they can “feel” heartbeats.</strong> The conductivity of the ocean is 50 million times better than that of air. Prof Lewin of MIT calculated it to be only 2ohm. Erratic behavior makes for erratic heartbeats.</p><p><strong>I know</strong> sharks like cold water and thrashing food. No, there are very few sharks found in water that cold, and they tend to be scavenger types, like the Greenland shark. It was below freezing. That is another conspiracy theory founded on junk science.</p><h2>When did the Titanic sink?</h2><p>The Royal Mail Ship (RMS) Titanic sank on the wee hours of<strong> April 15, 1912,</strong> in the Atlantic Ocean. The ship struck an iceberg as it made its maiden trip from Southampton to New York City.</p><p>About 2,224 people were on board when the ship left England, but<strong> more than 1500</strong> died when it sank, making it the worst peacetime maritime disaster in history. The Titanic believed it was unsinkable and was therefore ill-prepared for such a tragedy.</p><p>The wreckage lies<strong> 12,500 ft</strong> below the ocean surface, and the bow has penetrated 55ft into the sea bed. The Titanic was by far the largest passenger ship ever built and was thought to be unsinkable, but ironically, it did not complete its maiden trip.</p><p>The bow was discovered<strong> 1,800 feet</strong> from the stern and was the more intact of the two.</p><p>One-and-a-half-hours after the vessel sank the RMS Carpathia located the survivors and transported 705 to New York where they were met by over 40,000 people who had responded to emergency calls.<strong> Millvina Dean,</strong> the last remaining survivor of the Titanic, died in May 2009.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>The vessel was fitted with state-of-the-art technology, including<strong> wireless communication systems, elevators, and electrical control panels.</strong> Theoretically, the ship was deemed unsinkable. More than a century after the disaster, experts are still debating on the circumstances that doomed the ship.</p><p><h3 class=jp-relatedposts-headline>Related</h3></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivmaC2b6%2FEpZybqpmpxm%2ByzGiYq51dqbWmvsRmqqGZoqDAbsPHnqmeZaSdsm7AyK2Yp6GTYsCiuspmaGpqZWmFcA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./why-sade-vowed-to-leave-and-never-return-to-jamaica.html><span>←</span><span>Why Sade Vowed to Leave and Never Return to Jamaica</span></a>
