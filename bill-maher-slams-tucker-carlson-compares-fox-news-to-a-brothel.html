Maher also noted that those texts were the last straw for Fox News having any chance at winning a trial.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=141 data-current-count=141 data-injectable=false>He also added that Carlson and his fellow anchors were “toeing the Trump line. Yet, behind the scenes they knew it was bullsh**!”&nbsp;<br></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=441 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=543 data-current-count=543 data-injectable=true>Although they settled with Dominion Voting Systems — the company that sued Fox News over their claims that the election was rigged — the network’s legal troubles are not over, as Fox News is <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">battling another similar lawsuit</a> involving a election technology company called Smartmatic. It’s almost guaranteed to cost Fox News another fortune since Smartmatic has already stated they will settle for no less than the same price Dominon settled for. Otherwise, they will happily go to trial, one that very few people think Fox News can win.</p><p data-characters=467 data-current-count=467 data-injectable=true>Later in his show, Maher made an odd comparison about the network, and anyone who watches Real Time knows that Maher doesn’t shy away from odd comparisons. Last month, he <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">compared Marjorie Taylor Greene to a leprechaun</a>. This time around, he set up his joke by initially explaining that he disagrees with Dominion’s statement that the settlement proves that lies have consequences. Maher countered, “Not really. It proves that lies have a large profit margin.”</p><p data-characters=266 data-current-count=266 data-injectable=false>Fox News makes <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">over $10 billion dollars a year</a> in profits, though it’s worth noting that less than $2 billion is net profit. Maher then made his comparison, saying, “It’s the cost of doing business. If you run a whorehouse, you gotta buy some Febreze.”&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=119 data-current-count=385 data-injectable=false>One can’t imagine that Febreze is overly thrilled with such a mention, but they’re probably not complaining either.</p><p data-characters=206 data-current-count=591 data-injectable=true>Former Fox News host Bill O’Reilly also <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">tore into the network earlier this week</a>, calling their continuous troubles a disaster and penning a public message stating that their “Nightmare will continue.”</p><p data-characters=103 data-current-count=103 data-injectable=false>Real Time with Bill Maher streams on Friday nights on what is still called HBOMax, soon to be just Max.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmegpLmqwMicqmiamaG5brnAoZyrZaOhrq6%2FjK2snKOVp3qkrdGlqqimXZi8rrzAq5ysZZakxW66xLCqZqyfYq5urtGoq6GdnGQ%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./a-full-hearted-dwayne-johnson-drama-scores-big-on-streaming.html><span>←</span><span>A full-hearted Dwayne Johnson drama scores big on streaming</span></a>
