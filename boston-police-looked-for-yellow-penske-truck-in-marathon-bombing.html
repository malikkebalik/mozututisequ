Earlier, Boston police were asked by the FBI to look out for a yellow Penske truck with an unidentified driver, according to emergency services radio scanner chatter.
The dispatcher advised officers to &#34;approach with caution.&#34;
The truck apparently attempted to deliver medical supplies near the marathon earlier in the day but was turned away."><meta name=author content="Aldo Pusey"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>
