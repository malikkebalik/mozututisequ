Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson is undoubtedly one of the most profitable and sought-after working actors in Hollywood today — with major projects like San Andreas, Rampage, Fast Five, and (very soon) Black Adam under his belt. But, before Johnson was fully bathed in his influential big-movie stardom, his leading role in sports drama Gridiron Gang uncovered the world of heartfelt football and showcased some of Johnson’s best work.
Recommended Videos Directed by Phil Joanou, Johnson stars as Coach Sean Porter — a no-nonsense worker at a juvenile detention camp who, after fearing for the future lives of the boys in the juvenile system, begins a football program at the center to keep the boys out of trouble and to implement team-oriented skill sets and discipline.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Bill Maher slams Tucker Carlson, compares Fox News to a brothel</h2><time>Sep 29, 2024</time>

Even though Ted 2, like its predecessor, spends most of its time telling inappropriate jokes and displaying some very inappropriate behavior, the movie also contains some quiet moments of reflection, heart and, in one instance, song. In a scene partway through the film, while John (Mark Wahlberg), Sam (Amanda Seyfried) and Ted (Seth MacFarlane) are stranded at a pot farm in the middle of the night, Ted happens to find a guitar in an abandoned barn — and guess what?</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Did Tina Turner Quietly Pay $76 Million For A Lakefront Estate In Switzerland?</h2><time>Sep 28, 2024</time>

For its first half, “When We Are in Need” is one of the more subdued episodes of The Last of Us’s first season. We’ve not left Colorado yet, and Ellie is still there, tending to Joel’s wounds from a previous episode. After multiple episodes this season in which the infected only made brief appearances, this episode features zero such characters.
Most of the early conflict consists of characters hanging around in the dreary weather and lamenting their hunger and other hardships.</article><nav class=main-nav><a class=prev href=../../../../categories/blog/>← Prev Page</a>
