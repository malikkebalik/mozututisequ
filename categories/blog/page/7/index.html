Last night was the forth episode of the 16th season of Castle and we recapped it.&nbsp; Welcome to the wrap up of Castle episode number 11 ‚ÄúTil Death Do Us Part‚Äù ‚Äì and boy, was I ever on the edge of my seat although the violence was pretty intense!
What did you think of Rick bringing his daughter, Alexis, along? Was Kate right to be jealous ‚Äì or was she just pissed that she isn‚Äôt getting enough alone time with Rick?</article><article class=post-entry><h2>How the 'Stacks' Edwards Character Matched His Real-Life Counterpart</h2><time>Sep 20, 2024</time>

If you watch Goodfellas (1990) during its 30th anniversary, you‚Äôll see some familiar faces in small parts. Start with Michael Imperioli, who went on to play Christopher Moltisanti on The Sopranos. Imperioli had his breakout role playing Spider, the kid who got in the wrong psychopath‚Äôs way. Vincent Pastore, who played Sal ‚ÄúBig Pussy‚Äù Bonpensiero on The Sopranos, played an even smaller role in Goodfellas. After Henry Hill (Ray Liotta) introduces the crew at the Bamboo Lounge, you see Pastore moving around a rack of fur coats.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Jim Toth had a midlife crisis a few years ago, he &amp;amp; Reese both wanted out</h2><time>Sep 20, 2024</time>

I‚Äôm not sure how scandalous Reese Witherspoon and Jim Toth‚Äôs divorce will be, but I am interested to see if there will be any disputes which spill out into the public sphere. My guess is that no, nothing will spill out ‚Äì this separation and presumptive divorce has been a long time coming, by most accounts. Reese and Jim have already begun separating their finances and my guess is that they‚Äôve already started working with a private judge to negotiate all of the financial and custodial issues.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Kevin Costner was blindsided by his wifes divorce filing, he would take her back</h2><time>Sep 20, 2024</time>

So far, no one has the tea on exactly why Christine Baumgartner filed for divorce from Kevin Costner. They were married for nearly nineteen years and together for twenty-five years. They have three kids together, two teens and a tween. She‚Äôs asking for joint custody and reportedly, there‚Äôs a pretty strict prenup in place. The sudden nature of Baumgartner‚Äôs divorce filing has led to speculation that Costner was cheating and she just found out.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Latest Fantasy News: The Lord of the Rings cast cant get enough of The Rings of Power</h2><time>Sep 20, 2024</time>

I don‚Äôt know about you, but several times a year (OK, fine, it‚Äôs more like every month) I feel the urge to get away. It doesn‚Äôt help that I follow about a dozen travel accounts on Instagram, but more than pristine beaches and exotic jungles, I‚Äôm lured into a dreamscape by the cobbled streets and architectural wonders of Europe. Oh, Europe, you beautiful thing: with your diverse culture, history, architecture, art, and food, you're a total tease for those with wanderlust.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Jonny Lee Miller: I grew up in a very socialist household Im pretty leftie</h2><time>Sep 19, 2024</time>

For The Crown‚Äôs Season 4, everyone knew that the Margaret Thatcher role would be a huge showcase for the right actress, and there actually was a palpable sense of relief when Gillian Anderson took the part. While Thatcher‚Äôs old henchmen came out of the woodwork to complain about Season 4, I think at the end of the day, The Crown was pretty kind to Thatcher overall, and one of the best things the show did was show how deeply removed Thatcher and the Windsors were from the economic devastation Thatcher largely caused.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Lil Mabu Wikipedia And Age Family And Net Worth</h2><time>Sep 19, 2024</time>
