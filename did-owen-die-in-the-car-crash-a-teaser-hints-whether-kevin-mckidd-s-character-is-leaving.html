A new teaser from the winter premiere episode just spoiled Owen’s fate.</p><p id=par-2_15><strong>[Warning: This article contains spoilers about Owen Hunt from </strong><strong>Grey’s Anatomy</strong><strong> Season 18 Episode 9.]</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-why-some-grey-s-anatomy-fans-think-owen-hunt-is-dead-after-season-18-episode-8>Why some ‘Grey’s Anatomy’ fans think Owen Hunt is dead after season 18 episode 8</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Owen-Hunt-Kevin-McKidd-Greys-Anatomy-Season-18-Episode-8.jpg><p id=par-3_60>In the <a href=#>Grey’s Anatomy Season 18</a> winter finale, Owen was coming back to Grey Sloan Memorial with Farouk’s (Bardia Seiri) donor heart. The trauma surgeon was accompanied by Teddy Altman (Kim Raver) and Cormac Hayes (Richard Flood). Then in a turn of events, the driver had a stroke and died before crashing the car on the edge of a cliff.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-4_45>Eventually, Teddy and Hayes escaped the vehicle before it slid off the edge. So hopefully, Farouk is able to receive his heart. But unfortunately, Owen didn’t make it, and he could be dead going into the Grey’s Anatomy and Station 19 crossover on Feb. 24.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>‘Grey’s Anatomy’ Season 18 teaser seemingly spoils whether Owen died in the car accident</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-2></figure><p id=par-5_32>Before Grey’s Anatomy Season 18 Episode 9 aired on ABC, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Good Morning America</a> shared a teaser clip from the Feb. 24 crossover seemingly revealing whether Owen died or survived the car crash.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-6_14>“Teddy he’s alive,” Amelia Shepherd (Caterina Scorsone) says. “You can go and see him.”</p><p id=par-7_8>That said, it’s clear Teddy is still shaken.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-8_36>“He got me out of the car first, and I went to call for help,” Teddy says. “Then I heard the car fall, and I rode all the way here with Farouk’s heart in my hands.”</p><p id=par-9_63>Now, it seems like Owen didn’t immediately die in the car crash from the Grey’s Anatomy Season 18 winter finale. But it’s possible the character’s life is still in danger as the new season moves forward. Whatever the case, many fans are hoping Owen doesn’t pull an <a href=#>Andrew DeLuca (Giacomo Gianniotti)</a> or <a href=#>Mark Sloan (Eric Dane)</a> by dying after surviving a traumatic event.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Kim Raver teases what’s next in ‘Grey’s Anatomy’ Season 18 Episode 9</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-3></figure><p id=par-10_59>While Grey’s Anatomy fans have to wait and see <a href=#>what happens to Owen</a> after surviving the car crash, it seems like season 18 episode 9 sets up quite the journey moving forward.
