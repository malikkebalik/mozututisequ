Chamberlain has a unique item in her house that speaks to her personality, a chain-link chandelier.</p><p id=par-6_38>One look at the chandelier, and you’ll be excused for thinking it’s an arts and crafts project, but that couldn’t be further from the case. The item is a Cerine Triple Elongated Chandelier from the brand <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Trueing</a>.</p><p id=par-7_38>According to the brand’s official website, the statement chandelier comes in various color options and metal finishes. If you’re wondering how much you’ll need to fork out for this lovely chandelier, the piece carries a $31,800 price tag.</p><h2 id=h-how-much-does-emma-chamberlain-s-house-cost>How much does Emma Chamberlain’s house cost?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p></figure><p id=par-8_40>Barely a year after owning her ‘starter’ <a href=#>Los Angeles home</a>, Chamberlain put it back on the market, claiming the surrounding was noisy and crowded. The star traded the $5.26 million for a 1950s beauty in the mountains above Beverly Hills.</p><p id=par-9_53>Despite exchanging hands severally over the years, the house has retained most of its original characteristics, and Chamberlain’s designs only add to its retro style even more. The residence features a 4,400-square-foot living space with sunroofs flooding the room with light. The living space also has a fireplace set into a stone mantle.</p><p id=par-10_71>The atrium dining room serves as a connection for the other public rooms in the home. The kitchen has been upgraded with high-end stainless appliances and features a calming color palette consisting of mint green and sage, which go well with the marble countertops fitted by the star. The residence is a 5-bed, 5.5-bath home, costing the YouTube sensation $4.3 million, down from the initial price of $4.7 million per <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Dirt</a>.</p><h2 id=h-the-chain-link-chandelier-isn-t-the-only-expensive-item-in-emma-chamberlain-s-house>The chain-link Chandelier isn’t the only expensive item in Emma Chamberlain’s house</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-4></figure><p id=par-11_40>Chamberlain’s house is the true definition of opulence and class. Aside from the Trueing chain-link statement chandelier, the <a href=#>residence</a> has several expensive items. Chamberlain’s music and TV room has a poofy couch that looks (and possibly feels) like a cloud.</p><p id=par-12_74>The couch is a white Mario Bellini B&B Italia Camaleonda White Boucle sofa from 1st Dibs that fetches a $19,502 price tag. Chamberlain seems to be a fan of 1st Dibs as she has a 3 Orbit Table Lamp ($2,650) and a Giraffe Dining Chair ($1,690) from the brand. She also has a green Daisy Sconce from Eny Lee Parker that costs $1,800 and an Ultrafragola Mirror from The Future Perfect that costs $11,950.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGSyrrnAZpqhmZ2XsrO4wKKlrGWTna6quoyloKejXZi1orrDnqOinaJiwLWt0a2qZmthbX1xesetpKVn</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./eddie-jordan-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Eddie Jordan Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</span></a>
