The serial killer has been dubbed “the Hollow Man”.</p><p>He targets indigenous women on a reservation and several bodies have been found lately. They were all cut up. The only new piece of evidence was that one of the women escaped the killer. The victim is Shenoa Fermy. She got into a car with a stranger because he promised her a hit. Shenoa was a sex worker.</p><p>She was selling herself to get drugs and this Hollow Man had seemed like he was willing to give her flat out drugs in return for sexual favors. Only he reneged on the deal. He pulled a gun on her. She fought back. She got out of there and she ran back to the gas station to get help.</p><p>Shenoa said she left her purse in the guy’s car. She also said the Hollow Man was Mohawk like her. He was on the short side and she called him rat-like. The FBI looked into Mohawk men with guns.</p><p>They found Eddie Lauda. He has an official gun because he works in law enforcement. His car matches the one that picked up Shenoa. Shenoa’s purse was still found in the front seat of his car. This gave them probably cause to search the vehicle and Remy knocked on Lauda’s door. Lauda was married with a little boy. They have crucifixes everywhere. Lauda and his wife were very religious.</p><p>It doesn’t make sense why Lauda would target sex workers. The feds still lured Lauda to the house. They arrested him and he swears he’s not the Hollow Man. He said it was another guy.</p><p>He also said he drew his gun because Shenoa was acting erratic. He pulled the gun to defend himself. He had alibi for the murders. He wasn’t even living on the reservation at the time and so he got booked on assault against Shenoa. It’s the only charge they knew he was guilty of. The team also went back to looking for their serial killer.</p><p>Their serial killer was often taking breaks. He killed once in the fall. He killed three times in the winter. His kill schedule matched the schedule for the clinic that comes into town.</p><p>It was the only clinic that was opened for people on reservation. This clinic was for women. Their killer was stalking the clinic. He’d find a victim. He’d slash their car tires. He drove behind them until they had issues with their cars and that’s when he swoops in like a knight shinning armor. And he tortures these women for a couple of days before cutting them to death.</p><p>The clinic has just reopened that day. The FBI went there. They found one car with a slashed tire. They were so focused on that they didn’t notice the killer had already gotten his victim.</p><p>They were later informed when Maya’s car was found abandoned by the sound of the road. Someone had slashed her tires. The Hollow Man has his intended victim. He was going to torture her over the next two days. The FBI has two days to find Maya. Maya was pregnant. She was eight months along and she was told she might deliver sooner because of her size.</p><p>Maya was petite. The Hollow Man likes petite indigenous women. FBI working with Reservation police they looked into men returning from offshore jobs. They found Hank Fuller.</p><p>Fuller was taken away from his mother as a child because she refused to feed him. It led to a lifelong problem with food. Fuller works at the fish plant. He got sick while working with Alaska. He was diagnosed with cancer. He started reading alternative treatments. The feds found a book at his apartment about eating healthy flesh to get healthier. They also found organs he harvested from his other victims.</p><p>Fuller had taken Maya because he wants to each her placenta. He drove out to a cabin. He tried to force her to eat laxatives and she was fighting back when the feds showed up.</p><p>Maya ran off in one direction. Fuller stopped pursuing her when he saw the feds. Maya went on to fall off a cliff. She needed to be rescued. Fuller meanwhile tried to hide in another cabin nearby. This cabin was where he cuts into his victims. There was actually a dead woman inside when the feds knocked down the door. And they saw that he left his knife to grab his gun.</p><p>Fuller tried shooting his way out. He was eventually stopped. He was killed and so the feds could devote the rest of their time into rescuing Maya off that cliff. Remy propelled himself down.</p><p>He reached Maya. He slowly was lowered down the cliff with Maya in his arms. She was now safe. The taskforce saved the day. And Sheryll Barnes returned home to a wife that now wants out of the marriage.</p><p>Her wife had unfortunately met someone.</p><p>THE END!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmdoaKpxq2t1Kebq7FemLyue5FpaW1nlpe2brnOrKtmr5GjwaawjKucnJmgYn10eZBrZGtsXaiyor%2FOp2RuZZWltrS7w55kbWWYpLmtu9Zo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./see-inside-lebron-james-new-23-million-la-mansion.html><span>←</span><span>See Inside LeBron James' New $23 Million LA Mansion</span></a>
