Trina will definitely need some guidance when it comes to the problems that’ll be bubbling up with Spencer, who’ll make a desperate plea to Esme.</p><p>It sounds like Spencer will beg Esme not to move out with Ace, but will her mind be made up?</p><p>Regardless, GH spoilers say Trina won’t approve of Spencer fighting so hard to hang onto this fill-in father position in Ace’s life.</p><p>Josslyn Jacks (Eden McCoy) will give Spencer a reality check later, but she may need one of her own since Dex Heller (Evan Hofer) will eventually offer a warning.</p><p>Dex may have concerns about Adam (Joshua Benard) and the potential for him to go off the rails. Adam could be more dangerous than he seems, so Dex may push Josslyn to stay on guard.</p><p>While Hamilton Finn (Michael Easton) reacts to some awful news, TJ Ashford (Tajh Bellow) and Molly Lansing-Davis (Kristen Vaganos) will face an unexpected surrogacy hurdle.</p><p>It’ll leave Molly and TJ in an incredibly difficult situation.</p><p>Although Cyrus will dish out some threats elsewhere, Ava might confront him and make it clear that she’s done being afraid of him.</p><p>There’ll also be a stunning announcement from Maxie Jones (Kirsten Storms), so we’ll see if that involves Deception’s future or something else.</p><p>Finally, Willow will offer some encouraging words to Carly and could perhaps give her a nudge to accept Nina’s Metro Court deal.</p><p>It may be an olive branch in Willow’s eyes, but she won’t realize Michael blackmailed Nina into this.</p><p>General Hospital spoilers say the next two weeks will bring some surprises all over town, so stay tuned.</p><p>CDL’s where you want to be for fantastic <a href=# rel=noopener>General Hospital spoilers, updates and news, so make us your favorite GH hotspot.</a></p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmdoaKpxq2t1Kebq7FemLyue5FpaWxnl5q7pr7ApWShp6OltrWty2aqqaeZobKzv4ynnLGsXWd6uLHEpKpmppmjrrR51quYraBdlsK0wMinqmaon6G2pLGMnKannpWowKq7zWaYp5xdqLyvutisZKaxo6mys8WO</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./fear4less-face-reveal-what-does-the-gamer-look-like.html><span>←</span><span>Fear4less Face Reveal: What Does The Gamer Look Like?</span></a>
