In fact, the actress has been married three times. She met her first husband, Cabot Wade, in the cult.</p><p id=par-7_39>“I had a weird upbringing,” she told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Parade</a> in an interview earlier this year. “I think that was basically an arranged marriage, actually, that’s a whole other story.” The marriage ended when Close was just 22.</p><p id=par-8_45>After that, she married James Marlas, a businessman, but the relationship ended after three years. Then, she dated producer, John Starke, for four years and had a daughter, Annie Starke, with him. Her finale marriage lasted nine years and was with venture capitalist, David Shaw.</p><p id=par-9_15>Close believes her time in the cult hurt her chances of finding a lifelong partner.</p><p id=par-10_76>“Because of the devastation, emotional and psychological of the cult, I have not been successful in my relationships and finding a permanent partner and I am sorry about that,” she said in the docuseries. “I think it is our natural state to be connected like that. I don’t think you ever change your trigger points, but at least you can be aware of them and maybe avoid situations that might make you vulnerable, especially in relationships.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-glen-close-has-reconnected-with-her-family>Glen Close has reconnected with her family</h2><p id=par-11_30>Close spent most of her life after leaving the cult away from her family. Now, she has reconnected with her sisters, Jessie and Tina, and lives in Montana near them.</p><p id=par-12_29>“I’ve come back to my family,” Close said. “I’m connected to them, when I used to be a whole country away from them for all of my career.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p></figure><p id=par-13_24>Close and her sisters also delved into mental health on the docuseries and revealed how Close was able to get her sister, Jessie, help.</p><p id=par-14_80>“We all happened to be in my parents’ house in Wyoming, and I remember her kids were already loaded in her car and she came up to me across the driveway and said, ‘I need help. I can’t stop thinking about killing myself,'” Close recalled. “For me, it was a shock. She ended up in McLean Hospital&nbsp;— a psychiatric hospital in Massachusetts — I took her there. She was finally, at age 50, properly diagnosed as bipolar 1&nbsp;with psychotic tendencies.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS0rbHNp2ScpJ%2Bosm6%2BxK%2BcmqSjYsGpsYyhnJqqpJe%2Fpq3KoqWgZaKarrS7zWaqoZ2jYrumwsSrZJ%2BnpaOxbq2MqZyrpZGjsq%2FAjKmYq6yemr9vtNOmo2g%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./annie-lennox-s-net-worth-2021-update.html><span>←</span><span>Annie Lennoxs Net Worth [2021 Update]</span></a>
