The alien phone number is from a pizza shop, but the owner has no idea who Asta and Harry are looking for. Harry sees a mural and a signature in his language down the block.</p><p id=par-4_51>With a Google search, they learn Goliath is a version of Banksy. He is a famous and well-known artist the public has never seen. While in a pie shop, Harry notices the locations of the murals pinpoint stars in the night sky. One location, in particular, marks his planet’s sun.</p><p id=par-5_50>Later in the episode, Harry and Asta visit a gallery show in the set location.

A fan on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Reddit</a> wondered if the paintings in the gallery are by a real-life artist. The answer is yes. A deep dive on IMDb reveals the artist’s name is Joe Vaux. His <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram</a> and LinkTree show his elaborate and whimsical artwork.</p><p id=par-7_31>Vaux has posted snapshots of his work used in Resident Alien Season 2 as Goliath’s art.

Vaux is titled as a Storyboard / Revisionist, director, and assistant director for the animated series, credited for episodes since 2005.
