They agree to pick up a woman who has an ectopic pregnancy in Idaho, so she can get treatment in a state that isn’t affected by anti-abortion laws.</p><p id=par-4_27>Sadly, the patient started hemorrhaging. Addison tried to slow the bleeding by inserting a balloon. But the traffic slowed them down too much, and the mother died.</p><p id=par-5_41>Addison talked about her anger over the thought of more women dying because of these laws; she wants to do more in other states. Bailey said she should go to southern Illinois because it’s near Missouri, Arkansas, Tennessee, Kentucky, and Mississippi.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-6_23>She also offered Addison Ben’s (<a href=#>Jason Winston George</a>) PRT, an O.R. on wheels. The city sidelined it, so it’s currently not being used.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>‘Grey’s Anatomy’ fans hope ‘Private Practice’ returns to follow Addison’s move</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-3></figure><p id=par-7_29>The episode’s ending means Addison probably won’t be on Grey’s Anatomy for a while. But <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Reddit</a> fans hoped this story meant their other beloved medical show could come back.</p><p id=par-8_30>“Shonda has said she wants to bring back Private Practice. Watching Addy makes me want it so bad. (Assuming she isn’t planning a full time Grey’s return),” one fan wrote.</p><p id=par-9_8>“I need Charlotte king back,” someone else replied.</p><p id=par-10_14>“Man if she came in as chief I will be happy,” another fan added.</p><p id=par-11_21>“And this is such a cool concept. Recently there’s been stories about Planned Parenthood launching mobile ​​abortion clinic.” a viewer commented.</p><p id=par-12_42>“OMG PLEASE BAILEY AND ADDISON PRIVATE PRACTICE REBOOT PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE??? Edit but I guess that would pull Ben from Seattle unless they split up arguing over this… it would definitely give him an interesting twist for the show,” one fan begged.</p><p id=par-13_4>“Mobile practice!” someone joked.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-shonda-rhimes-says-private-practice-has-more-stories-to-tell>Shonda Rhimes says ‘Private Practice’ has more stories to tell</h2><p id=par-14_21>So what did the show creator really say about the spinoff about Grey’s Anatomy‘s Addison? <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Deadline</a> reported Rhimes misses multiple shows.</p><p id=par-15_88>“I miss my <a href=#>Scandal</a> family so badly that I would come back with them at any point, but I actually feel like we didn’t finish telling our stories on Private Practice,” she said. “We had so many more stories we could tell … I just felt like we had so much more to say with those characters and so much further to go, and that also felt like a show that had endless possibility where you are learning and seeing things happen at the same things happen medically.”</p><p id=par-16_30>Private Practice ended in 2013. Rhimes has moved on to getting a deal with Netflix. But it looks like her ABC shows still has a special place in her heart.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS0s7HYrGSappGpvK7FjJ%2BYp6tdnbyxsYypqaKukamybrzRmpqtoZOaerOx066pp6tdlrGltdKopaxlnprEbr%2FTqKmyZpipuq17</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./leslie-lampton-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Leslie Lampton Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</span></a>
