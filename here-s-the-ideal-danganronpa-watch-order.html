This is because the game has been expanded into an anime that expands the franchise and the storylines.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=178 data-current-count=178 data-injectable=false>Although the anime is not able to include every single detail from the games, it gives people who are new to the Danganronpa world an understanding of what it’s all about.</p><p data-characters=338 data-current-count=516 data-injectable=true>If you’re on the hunt for a series with an expansive universe to immerse yourself in, then Danganronpa is a perfect choice. Every few years a new entry is made into the franchise, be it a game or an animation, and there appears to be no sign of slowing down following the 2021 arrival of the RPG Danganronpa S: Ultimate Summer Camp.</p><p data-characters=208 data-current-count=208 data-injectable=false>Whether you’re a fan trying to follow along with the story or someone new attempting to get into the franchise for the first time, here are the best ways to go about taking in the full Danganronpa universe.</p><h2 id=h-danganronpa-watch-order data-injectable=false>Danganronpa watch order</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image-14.png><p data-characters=342 data-current-count=342 data-injectable=false>Danganronpa is unique because there aren’t just multiple seasons of the animated series ⏤ there’s also an OVA, a special, and a ton of games. Because of this, there are two ways to take in everything Dangaronpa has to offer, with or without video games. First, here’s a list of how to watch the series with just video content.</p><h3 id=h-danganronpa-2013 data-injectable=false>Danganronpa (2013)</h3><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=642 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=403 data-current-count=403 data-injectable=true>To kick things off, you’ll want to watch the titular series that first aired in 2013. Danganronpa will introduce you to 16 students trapped within Hope’s Peak Academy as Monokuma, an animatronic bear, attempts to entice them into killing classmates to graduate. The series condenses the same story that you can experience for yourself in Danganronpa’s first game, Trigger Happy Havoc.</p><p data-characters=161 data-current-count=161 data-injectable=false>If you watch this series and enjoy it, then it’s recommended that you play the game, as it elaborates on further details that the show doesn’t cover.</p><h3 id=h-danganronpa-3-the-end-of-hope-s-peak-high-school-future-arc-2016 data-injectable=false>Danganronpa 3: The End of Hope’s Peak High School – Future Arc (2016)</h3><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=461 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=345 data-current-count=345 data-injectable=false>Rounding out the Hope’s Peak Academy arc is the three-part End of Hope’s Peak High School release. This kicks off with the Future Arc that follows Makoto Naegi and others with their involvement in the Future Foundation killing game. This is the first entry into the two-part series that concludes with a further one-episode special.</p><p data-characters=104 data-current-count=449 data-injectable=true>To get the full story of this arc, you’ll want to binge all of the following entries back-to-back.</p><h3 id=h-danganronpa-3-the-end-of-hope-s-peak-high-school-despair-arc-2016 data-injectable=false>Danganronpa 3: The End of Hope’s Peak High School – Despair Arc (2016)</h3><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=223 data-current-count=523 data-injectable=true>Kicking off straight after, the Despair Arc puts the spotlight on Hajime Hinata and the experiments he held on other humans. Again, this takes place right after the Future Arc, so the best way to view them is back-to-back.</p><p data-characters=136 data-current-count=136 data-injectable=false>Before you conclude this story, there’s another Danganronpa adventure to check out next that’s separate from the main story.</p><h3 id=h-super-danganronpa-2-5-kimaeda-nagito-to-sekai-no-hakaimono-2017 data-injectable=false>Super Danganronpa 2.5: Kimaeda Nagito to Sekai no Hakaimono (2017)</h3><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=436 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=181 data-current-count=181 data-injectable=false>This one-episode OVA is in the same universe but separate from the story of the main anime. You’ll follow Nagito Komaeda, whose bad luck winds up working out well for others.</p><p data-characters=139 data-current-count=320 data-injectable=false>After suffering a terrible death, Nagito lives within his own mind, which is a peaceful existence until The Destroyer of the World arrives.</p><h3 id=h-danganronpa-3-the-end-of-hope-s-peak-high-school-hope-arc-2016 data-injectable=false>Danganronpa 3: The End of Hope’s Peak High School – Hope Arc (2016)</h3><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=620 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=283 data-current-count=283 data-injectable=false>Part three, the Hope Arc, brings the anime to its conclusion, both rounding out The End of Hope’s Peak High School and the story as a whole. For this reason, you won’t want to miss this addition to the franchise even if you plan on using the games as the main story tool.</p><h2 id=h-danganronpa-watch-order-with-games data-injectable=false>Danganronpa watch order with games</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image-15.png><p data-characters=186 data-current-count=186 data-injectable=false>If you’re looking to add the games to your binge, things can get a little more confusing (but also more fun), as some are interchangeable.
