Years later, he dropped out of high school his freshman year. Soon he began working for his father as a carpenter.</p><p id=par-4_26>But one day on the job, Ross lost half of his left index finger. Luckily, the lost appendage wouldn’t affect his ability to hold a paintbrush.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><p id=par-5_43>Of all places,&nbsp;<a href=#>Ross</a>&nbsp;developed his interest in painting during his military career. When he was 18 years old, he enlisted in the U.S. Air Force. He rose through the ranks, retiring as a master sergeant at the end of his 20-year military career.</p><p id=par-6_35>During this time, Ross also began taking art classes. He studied other artists and mastered painting techniques. Just two years after retiring from the Air Force, he landed his own TV show,&nbsp;The Joy of Painting.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p></figure><p id=par-7_52>On&nbsp;The Joy of Painting,&nbsp;<a href=#>Ross</a>&nbsp;inspired millions of people worldwide to pick up a paintbrush. He specialized in painting landscape scenes with his unique wet-on-wet oil painting technique. His soothing voice, encouraging attitude, and philosophical outlook on life, love, and art captivated audiences. These qualities also encouraged millions to try painting through his tutorials.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-8_68>Though&nbsp;The Joy of Painting&nbsp;ended in 1994, episodes still air regularly on PBS and Twitch. Ross rose to fame on the show and became a legend of the art community. Decades later, he’s still inspiring new artists to perfect the craft of painting. According to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Two Inch Brush</a>, because reruns of&nbsp;The Joy of Painting&nbsp;are still airing, many viewers are surprised to learn that the artist is no longer with us.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-he-battled-cancer-in-secret><strong>He battled cancer in secret&nbsp;</strong></h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-4><p></p></figure><p id=par-9_45>Through reruns of&nbsp;The Joy of Painting, the beloved Bob Ross continues to teach people how to paint. But while recording episodes for his series, he was diagnosed with lymphoma. He decided to keep his cancer diagnosis a secret from his audience and the public.</p><p id=par-10_37>Ross lost his battle on July 4, 1995. His death came as a shock to many fans. No one outside of his family and close friends knew of his diagnosis. He died at just 52 years old.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-11_55>After his untimely death, his family found a way to keep his legacy alive.&nbsp;Bob Ross Inc. sells hundreds of painting supplies, books, and recordings of the TV show. You can buy Bob Ross-branded paints, brushes, coffee mugs, graphic tees, and even underwear, but getting your hands on a Bob Ross original painting is difficult.</p><p id=par-12_43>According to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Hustle</a>, Ross produced over 30,000 paintings. However, these original pieces rarely pop up for sale. When they appear, they generally fetch $10,000 or more. Though the beloved artist is gone, he still makes an impact on the art community today.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGSvprjOr5ydZZGnwaq%2F02aZqJpdp7y0v4ydoJ5mmKm6rXs%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./get-a-first-glimpse-at-tom-hiddleston-and-mia-wasikowska-in-crimson-peak.html><span>←</span><span>Get A First Glimpse At Tom Hiddleston And Mia Wasikowska In Crimson Peak</span></a>
