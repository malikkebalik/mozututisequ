He was praised for his dedication and acting skill. He was also admired for his kindness. Karen Grassle (<a href=#>she played Caroline Ingalls</a>) says Greer was “gentlemanly.” In her book, Bright Lights, Prairie Dust, Grassle says she was impressed when she first met Greer. She enjoyed how his character led the members of Walnut Grove “in sermons with simple morals.”</p><p id=par-3_55>Grassle appreciated the way Greer made his castmates feel comfortable. She describes him as “a large man from Missouri” with a soft voice. According to her, his Southern accent is what made his voice warm and welcoming. She thought he was perfect for the role of a reverend because he was kind in real life.</p><p id=par-4_40>Grassle says Greer was so kind that this quality “emanated” from him. She says whenever he was on the set, she felt happy. “He was so warm and gentlemanly and had such a light touch,” she says in her book.</p><p id=par-5_66>Grassle connected with Greer after he told her she reminded him of Ingrid Bergman. This compliment meant a lot to Grassle, who was a big fan of hers. “I knew I didn’t hold a candle to her, but when I was first thinking of becoming an actress, I read her biography and admired both her beauty and her mettle, so the compliment hit deep,” wrote Grassle.</p><p id=par-6_51>Grassle also admired Greer’s work ethic. She says he consistently delivered “clean” work. According to her, he was always prompt and carried out his job with precision. Melissa Sue Anderson (<a href=#>she played Mary Ingalls</a>) agrees. In her book, The Way I See It, Anderson says Greer played his role “to perfection.”</p><h2>How Dabbs Greer died</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p id=par-7_64>Greer died as a result of complications from heart and kidney disease, reports <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">CBS News</a>.
