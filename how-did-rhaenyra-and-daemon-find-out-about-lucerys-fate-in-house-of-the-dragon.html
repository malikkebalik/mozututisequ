In short, Arrax decided to throw a stream of well-placed flames in Vhagar’s face, Vhagar wasn’t having it, and with one fell swoop, or in this case, chomp, disintegrated Arrax and Lucerys into a stream of fleshy chunks.</p><p data-characters=175 data-current-count=563 data-injectable=true>We then cut to a shot of Rhaenyra and Daemon hearing the news, and the episode ends with Rhaenyra giving the camera a menacing look, signaling that this pretty much means war.</p><p data-characters=250 data-current-count=250 data-injectable=false>The question on everyone’s minds is, how the heck did the news travel so fast? Are the Targaryens telepathic? Fret not, because George R.R Martin’s Fire and Blood, serving as the source material for House of the Dragon, has answers for you.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-how-rhaenyra-and-daemon-got-the-news data-injectable=false><strong>How Rhaenyra and Daemon got the news</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/house-of-the-dragon.jpg><p data-characters=351 data-current-count=351 data-injectable=false>Fire and Blood’s explanation is simple – three days following the aforementioned chomping, Arrax’s head and Lucerys’ corpse washed up beneath the cliffs of Storm’s End, where the deceased prince had initially gone to deliver his message from Queen Rhaenyra. However, this is all the detail that Fire and Blood divulged about the death.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=296 data-current-count=647 data-injectable=false>From there, we’re left to fill in the gaps ourselves, but presumably, the remains were discovered by someone at Storm’s End who then passed the message on to Dragonstone via raven. It’s at this point that House of the Dragon picks up and we get that final shot of Rhaenyra on the warpath.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3ypu9Zmm6KcXae1orHNsqmaZZGjsW6wwJ6kqKZdm7avsIyorK1lkZe8tsCMpaycnaKuwG6ywK2cZqGeYrWwwdKeZKieXam1pnnDq5igp55k</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./george-harrison-once-explained-why-the-beatles-stopped-touring-we-were-getting-no-pleasure-out-of.html><span>←</span><span>George Harrison Once Explained Why The Beatles Stopped Touring, 'We Were Getting No Pleasure Out of</span></a>
