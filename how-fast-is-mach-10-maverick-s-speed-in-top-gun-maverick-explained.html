The film producers worked alongside aviation company Lockheed Martin to come up with a beautiful, sleek, and realistic design for a theoretical aircraft capable of flying at speeds of Mach 10 and beyond. Pete “Maverick” Mitchell (<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Tom Cruise</a>) manages to fly for a few short moments at Mach 10.2 in a test run during one part of the movie.</p><p data-characters=103 data-current-count=103 data-injectable=false>“He’s the fastest man alive,” says Maverick’s friend and colleague,&nbsp;Hondo.</p><p data-characters=31 data-current-count=134 data-injectable=false>But how fast did he really go?</p><h2 id=h-mach-speed-in-top-gun-maverick-the-real-world-explained data-injectable=false>Mach speed in Top Gun: Maverick & the real world, explained</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=434 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=244 data-current-count=244 data-injectable=false>The <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Mach number</a> of an object is a measure of how fast it is going past the speed of sound. Mach 1 is the speed of sound (767 mph at sea level). Mach 2 is twice the speed of sound (1534 mph), and so on. On the face of it, the whopping Mach 10.2</p><p data-characters=174 data-current-count=418 data-injectable=true>Maverick achieved meant that he was flying at 7826 mph. If he continued consistently at these speeds, he could fly around the entire equator of the Earth in just three hours.</p><h2 id=h-is-it-possible data-injectable=false>Is it possible?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/sca1.png><p data-characters=401 data-current-count=701 data-injectable=true>Mach 10 stands on the cusp between hypersonic and high-hypersonic, meaning thermal control becomes a major issue. The stresses on the hull of such an aircraft mean that it behaves more like a space vehicle during re-entry. Aircraft designers need to think like rocket scientists, to prevent a Mach 10 plus aircraft from simply blowing up due to the incredible heat generated at those ludicrous speeds.</p><p data-characters=330 data-current-count=330 data-injectable=false>Plus, there is the problem of how much a human body could take. At Mach 10, the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">G-force</a> during acceleration would be colossal. An average person can withstand around 6 Gs for short periods. <a href=#>Highly trained</a> fighter pilots condition themselves to withstand up to 9 Gs for short bursts so they can perform high-speed aerial maneuvers.</p><p data-characters=249 data-current-count=579 data-injectable=true>But not even the “Top Guns” of the U.S. Air Force could withstand the sickening G-force inflicted on them for prolonged flights at Mach 10. A pilot would likely black out within seconds, putting themselves and the aircraft at grave risk.</p><p data-characters=331 data-current-count=331 data-injectable=false>In real life, only unmanned aerial vehicles are capable of getting anywhere near Mach 10. The fastest manned aircraft ever made was the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">North American X-15</a>, a jet shaped more like a rocket than a traditional aircraft. On October 3. 1967, it achieved a record speed of Mach 6.7 – very slow compared to the film antics of Maverick.</p><p data-characters=102 data-current-count=433 data-injectable=false>Whichever way you measure it, Pete <a href=#>“Maverick”</a> Mitchell was flying fast… really fast.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJon6ivXZuutMCMoqpmpZGYtW59j2akmq6Vp7akt9JmqqmdlZl6qrqMraapZZequ265wK%2Bcq6GToHqmxM%2BlmKKmlZl8</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./duck-dynasty-recap-6-11-14-season-6-premiere-governor-s-travels.html><span>←</span><span>Duck Dynasty Recap 6/11/14: Season 6 Premiere Governors Travels</span></a>
