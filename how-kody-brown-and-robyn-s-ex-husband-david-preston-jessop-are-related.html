Robyn wrote:</p><p>“I tried my hardest to make the marriage work, both for our own sake and for the sake of the three children my ex-husband and I had together. But what started off as unstable disintegrated into something destructive. After seven and a half years of marriage, we separated. A year and a half later, we were divorced.</p><p>Both my marriage and its collapse were incredibly difficult for me. I suffered a lot of pain and hardship. I had been badly mistreated and misled by my ex-husband. While I knew that he was the source of a lot of my grief, part of me still believed that I was a failure because I hadn’t been able to make my relationship work.”</p>Page 62 of Becoming Sister Wives — The Story of an Unconventional Marriage<p id=par-4_54>After her divorce in 2009, she met Kody at a church dance, and they began courting. On May 22, 2010, Kody and Robyn married spiritually. Then, Meri Brown divorced Kody so that he could legally marry Robyn with the purpose of adopting her children. Robyn and Kody legally married on Dec 11, 2014.</p><p id=par-5_41>Many Sister Wives fans have pointed out how similar David Jessop and Kody Brown look (via <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Reddit</a>).
