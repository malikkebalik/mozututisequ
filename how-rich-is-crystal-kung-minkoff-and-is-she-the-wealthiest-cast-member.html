When you don’t have a good defense, and when you have bigger issues besides the civil issues in bankruptcy, I can understand why a debtor would not mount a defense.”</p><p id=par-10_54>Allegations of a Ponzi scheme also emerged and suddenly reps for Girardi announced he had late-onset Alzheimer’s. Jayne is seen in the first episode getting emotional about her marriage. “I did not see it ending this way,” she said looking stoic but emotional. “I was going to hold that man’s hand until he died.”&nbsp;</p><p id=par-11_14>The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills is on Wednesday at 8/7c on Bravo.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS%2FqbvBoWShp6div6qvx2aaq7Gjqa6tecqupaBlnZ67rLvFn2SwnZGhwam1xKyrZpuRqMFuucSmmZ6qXp3BrriO</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./get-a-first-look-at-outlander-star-sam-heughan-in-his-very-sexy-new-series-the-couple-next-door.html><span>←</span><span>Get a First Look at 'Outlander' Star Sam Heughan In His 'Very Sexy' New Series 'The Couple Next Door</span></a>
