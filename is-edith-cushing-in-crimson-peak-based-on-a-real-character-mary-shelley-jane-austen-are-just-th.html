<span>Reinaldo Massengill</span></p><h1>Is Edith Cushing In 'Crimson Peak' Based On A Real Character? Mary Shelley &amp;amp; Jane Austen Are Just Th</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>As <i>Crimson Peak</i>'s Edith, Mia Wasikowska plays a writer, a Buffalo, New York native, who meets Tom Hiddleston's mysterious, eccentric British aristocrat Sir Thomas Sharpe, and his sister Lucille (Jessica Chastain). Edith is an aspiring novelist — fittingly, as her name, Edith Cushing, is a nod to both Edith Wharton, the author of <i>House of Mirth</i> and <i>The Age of Innocence</i>, and Peter Cushing, the British actor known primarily for his work on horror films with the Hammer studio. <i>Crimson Peak</i> director Guillermo Del Toro has also noted a number of literary references that contributed to the film's aesthetic, so <a href=# class=T3D>is Mia Wasikowska's <i>Crimson Peak</i> character based on a real writer</a>?</p><p>Edith draws comparisons to Jane Austen in <i>Crimson Peak</i>, which she perceives as a slight — she doesn't want to be a romance writer. She prefers horror. (She's in the right movie for that.) Her role model, instead, is Gothic horror writer Mary Shelley, the author best known for <i>Frankenstein</i>. But even when she writes ghost stories instead of romances, these are seen as quaint and endearing rather than terrifying. Unlike Shelley, who was treated as a serious novelist during her lifetime, Edith struggles to be taken seriously. (However, since Shelley's death, the author has been primarily remembered for <i>Frankenstein</i> alone among her written works, and beyond that, as the wife of Percy Bysshe Shelley.)</p><figure class="Qf5 E1M"></figure><p>Literary forbears aside, Edith isn't based on any one real writer; she's an amalgamation of influences based on the role of women in the Gothic horror movement in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. But <i>Crimson Peak</i> as a whole is similarly steeped in Gothic influences, many of which Del Toro has cited in interviews and likely influenced how he portrays Edith beyond her writerly aspirations.</p><p>In an interview with <i>The Daily Telegraph</i>, Del Toro cited film adaptations of both <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Shirley Jackson's <i>The Haunting of Hill House</i></a> and Henry James's <i>The Turn of the Screw</i> among the haunted-house precedents for <i>Crimson Peak</i>. In Jackson's novel, which was adapted in 1963 into <i>The Haunting</i>, a ghost hunter named Dr. Montague rents out Hill House in order to investigate claims that the manor is haunted. He's accompanied by a few friends (the only few friends who would accept his invitation to live in a haunted house, as it happens), and one early line in particular seems particularly relevant in the comparison to <i>Crimson Peak</i>: "<a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Hill House has a reputation for insistent hospitality</a>; it seemingly dislikes letting its guests get away." Hill House sounds quite a lot like Allerdale Hall. And as the <i>Wall Street Journal </i>reported, Jackson's story itself was based on an eerie sleepwalking tale from a Vermont housewife.</p><figure class="Qf5 E1M"></figure><p>Likewise, <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D><i>The Turn of the Screw</i> plays out in the traditional manner</a> of the haunted house tale. A narrator-governess is called upon to look after two British child-aristocrats, and she soon begins to see evidence that the house is haunted, and the children themselves might be responsible for summoning the ghosts. Edith's story in <i>Crimson Peak</i> has obvious precedents — the outsider, often a woman, arrives at a storied but mysterious mansion, perhaps a bit derelict, only to find that not everything is as it seems. Adding an additional layer of textual references — Edith's burgeoning career as a writer — only reinforces the literary influence that already infuses the film.</p><p>But it's also impossible to discuss Gothic influences without mentioning Horace Walpole's <i>Castle of Otranto</i>, the novella that arguably sparked the Gothic horror movement. It was published in 1764, and as a result it's one of the earliest novels that can be attributed to the Gothic movement. The familiar tropes are all there — a castle fallen into disrepair, maybe haunted, and in a distinct parallel with <i>Crimson Peak</i>, an aristocrat who marries a woman (fiancee of his late son, as it happens) <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>in order to avoid a dark prophecy becoming reality</a>.</p><p>So strong are <i>Crimson Peak</i>'s literary influences that it's earned the approval of Stephen King, the contemporary master of the horror genre. As the BBC noted, even Jane Austen's baroque Northanger Abbey is a romanticized nod to the haunted mansion that is as much a character as any man or woman in many Gothic novels. Though she's not based on any specific, true-to-life author, Mia Wasikowska's Edith Cushing bears clear influences from some of the most well-respected horror novels of the past 200 years, from Walpole's Isabella to Jackson's Montague.</p><p><i>Images: Universal Pictures</i></p><p>Get Even More From Bustle — Sign Up For The Newsletter</p><p>From hair trends to relationship advice, our daily newsletter has everything you need to sound like a person who’s on TikTok, even if you aren’t.</p><p>More like this</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o8HSraOeZpOkunCt0a2gnKSVqHxyfZVyb3Jlmah6prDIrZ9mm6Wotaq6xmagp2WTp7auv86nZKmdkaB6o63Snptmp55irm6%2BxJqjZpuYlr%2Bir9OeqWalkafGbr%2FHnqOlnalit6K6xGaYrqukmrs%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./bitchy-when-harry-met-sally-ending-scene-4-32-screenshot.html><span>←</span><span>bitchy | When Harry Met Sally Ending Scene 4-32 screenshot</span></a>
