Jim Carrey was the most famous actor in the world for about a decade. The man could do no wrong, and every comedic project he touched spelled massive amounts of money for the studio lucky enough to snag him for a lead role. Over a two decade period Jim was regularly one of the highest-paid actors in the world. His base salary was consistently $20+ million for a single movie. He was the <a href=#>first actor to earn $20 million for a movie</a> and has earned at least $300 million to date from film salaries and bonuses.</p><p>Jim Carrey had already established himself as a popular stand-up comedian in Canada, when he caught the eye of <a href=# title="Rodney Dangerfield Net Worth">Rodney Dangerfield</a> in the late 70s.&nbsp; After opening for Mr. Dangerfield on tour, he moved to Las Vegas, and then California.&nbsp; All the while, he continued to build a following for his incredible impressions and wacky sense of humor. In the early 80s, the television and film worlds came calling. After appearing in a series of low-budget films, and starring on the short-lived series, "The Duck Factory", he began to gain higher profile roles in such films as "Earth Girls Are Easy", "Once Bitten", and "Peggy Sue Got Married".</p><p>In the spring of 1990, he began appearing on the series, "In Living Color".&nbsp; The sketch comedy show would introduce him to an even wider audience, and bring a new level of fame.&nbsp; In 1994, he parlayed this television popularity into the lead role in the massive hit film, "Ace Ventura: Pet Detective".&nbsp; For the next ten years, he would dominate comedic film, appearing in a string of popular projects, including "The Mask", "Dumb and Dumber", "Liar Liar", and "Bruce Almighty", as well as a number of films that blurred the line between comedy and drama, including, "The Truman Show", "Man on the Moon", and "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind".</p><h2 id=highest-paid-actor><strong>Highest Paid Actor</strong></h2><p>In the late 1990s and 2000s, Jim was consistently one of the highest-paid entertainers in the world.

His mother was a homemaker and his father was an accountant. When Jim was 12, his father lost his job and the family was suddenly homeless. They entire family lived out of a van and worked overnight as janitors and security guards at a nearby factory to make ends meet. After a full day of school, a teenage Jim would frequently work a full eight-hour shift at the factory.</p><p>Always a natural comedian and impersonator (as was his father), Jim got his professional start doing stand-up in Toronto comedy clubs when he was just 15. In his early days, his father would drive him to clubs. He dropped out of high school to pursue his dreams and later moved to Los Angeles, where Rodney Dangerfield saw him perform at The Comedy Store and signed him as an opening act.</p><h2 id=blank-check-come-true><strong>Blank Check Come True</strong></h2><p>According to legend, at one point in 1985 an extremely broke and depressed Jim Carrey drove his beat-up Toyota Camry into the Hollywood Hills. Overlooking all of Los Angeles, Jim wrote himself a check for $10 million "for acting services rendered". He post-dated it 10 years later and kept the check in his wallet. Spoiler alert – his dream came true within that 10 year period. When Jim's dad died in 1994, he slipped the check into his father's casket.</p><h2 id=success><strong>Success</strong></h2><p>Carrey's first taste of stardom came in 1990 on the Wayans brothers' sketch comedy show "In Living Color". It was on this show, where he wowed audiences with characters like the masochistic and accident-prone Fire Marshal Bill. Carrey remained on In Living Color until it ended in 1995, but shortly before its cancellation, his major movie debut "Ace Ventura: Pet Detective" hit theaters. The movie was a smash hit that made him a household name overnight. The same year, he starred in "The Mask" and "Dumb and Dumber", both of which were box-office hits. For his next film, "The Cable Guy", he earned $20 million, setting a salary record.</p><p>Carrey's other notable comedic vehicles include "Liar, Liar", "Bruce Almighty", "Me, Myself, and Irene", and "Yes Man". He has also appeared in a number of dramas and dramedies, including "The Truman Show", "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind", "The Majestic", "Man on the Moon", and the thriller "The Number 23." More recently, Jim Carrey has played the role of Dr. Robotnik in "Sonic the Hedgehog" (2020) and "Sonic the Hedgehog 2" (2022). "Sonic the Hedgehog 2" gave Carrey the best opening of his career with a $72 million US box office opening weekend.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-262261 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Jim-Carrey.jpg alt width=594 height=414 sizes="(max-width: 594px) 100vw, 594px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-262261 class=wp-caption-text>Getty</p><h2 id=salary-highlights><strong>Salary Highlights</strong></h2><p>Jim's first major paycheck came from In Living Color. He earned $25,000 per episode of the sketch series which worked out to around $3.2 million from the show's 127 episodes. That's the same as around $6 million today.</p><p>In 1994 Jim was paid $350,000 for the first Ace Ventura movie. After the movie earned $100 million off its $15 million budget, Jim was quickly paid $15 million to appear in the sequel, which was released in 1996. In 1994 Jim earned $540,000 to star in "The Mask," which went on to make $350 million. He was paid $7 million to star in&nbsp; "Dumb & Dumber."</p><p>Jim was the very first actor in history to break the coveted $20 million base salary barrier, a feat he accomplished with 1996's "The Cable Guy." His $20 million salary was a little under half of the film's entire budget. FYI, earning $20 million in the mid-1990s is the same as earning around $34 million per movie today.</p><p>Jim went on to earn $20 million base salary for the following movies:</p><ul><li>The Cable Guy</li><li>Batman Forever</li><li>Liar Liar</li><li>Me, Myself & Irene</li><li>How the Grinch Stole Christmas</li><li>Yes Man</li></ul><p>For "How the Grinch Stole Christmas," Jim was also entitled to a percentage of merchandise sales. For "Yes Man," he was entitled to 36.2% of profits which brought his total payday to $35 million. That is one of the 30-largest paychecks in film history.</p><p>Between 1994 and 2008 alone, Jim earned $200 million from salaries and bonuses. Over the next decade he earned at least another $100 million. To date, he has likely earned more than $300 million in film salary.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-318155 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Jim-Carrey.jpg alt width=900 height=619 sizes="(max-width: 1303px) 100vw, 1303px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-318155 class=wp-caption-text>(Photo by Christopher Polk/Getty Images for AFI)</p><h2 id=personal-life><strong>Personal Life</strong></h2><p>Jim Carrey has been married twice.
