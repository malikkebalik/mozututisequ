Tommy Solomon has not only grown up good but also appears <a href=#>so grateful and enthusiastic</a> about his success and even looks good <a href=#>while pumping gas</a>. Now JGL appears in a new feature film, Don Jon (formerly titled Don Jon’s Addictions), that functions as his writing and directing debut. Last year, Kaiser covered <a href=#>some meathead set photos</a> where Joe looked a little too orange for my liking. Honestly, he looked like the ultimate “Jersey Shore” reject, which is saying something considering that I willingly watched every episode of that dumb show.</p><p>But now there’s a trailer for the Don Jon movie, <a href=#>which was a hit at Sundance</a> and was immediately picked up for global distribution, and the trailer is unavoidably charismatic. Kaiser, CB, and myself were all gushing over how surprisingly sweet this trailer appears. The words “cute” and “adorable” came to pass more than once. The trailer itself is a wee bit NSFW, but watch it, and you’ll probably like it too:</p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/donjon3.jpg alt="Joseph Gordon-Levitt" title="Joseph Gordon-Levitt" width=550 sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p></p><p>See, this movie co-stars Tony Danza JGL’s dad! Julianne Moore is in there too. Essentially, this is a very sweert rom-com with a pr0ny twist. That is, the titular Don Jon is obsessed with (as the trailer suggests) a few things, which include pr0n. Then he falls in love with Scarlett Johansson’s character, who adores cheesy romantic comedies just like Don Jon harbors a weakness for pr0n.</p><p>ScarJo does an excellent Joisey accent here (seriously, that’s some very effective gum smacking) and finally embraces her own sexuality (which she has steadfastly buried under wraps for the past few years) as an actress even though her character honestly doesn’t understand why Don Jon continues to watch his pr0n even though he has her. The premise sounds awful, I know, but the trailer says otherwise. The movie also stars Channing Tatum and Anne Hathaway in a movie-within-a-movie. It’s going to be a total sleeper and an unexpectedly great date movie, I just know it.</p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/donjon1.jpg alt="Joseph Gordon-Levitt" title="Joseph Gordon-Levitt" width=550 sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/donjon4.jpg alt="Joseph Gordon-Levitt" title="Joseph Gordon-Levitt" width=550 sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>Photos courtesy of <a href=#>Coming Soon</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmirJOdxm%2BvzqZma3FpbIRze8moqp6omJS0sL7DqKVmpJWrtrXAvqKlmKyYmqylu82Yoaimj6m%2ForXLnqmYmpWas7qrx6irmKulp72ztdKipaCkqZTAuLHErWY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./dwayne-johnson-rocks-around-the-christmas-tree-with-j-k-simmons-santa-claus-in-new-red-one.html><span>←</span><span>Dwayne Johnson Rocks around the Christmas tree with J.K.
