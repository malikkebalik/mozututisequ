The series featured one heck of a cameo, one that immediately had social media users debating whether or not <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">DC</a> </strong>made the right choice in passing over Grant Gustin. The actor has held the title of Scarlet Speedster on the CW’s TV show, which has been running for the entire, drama-filled production of The Flash.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=692 data-current-count=692 data-injectable=true>Meanwhile, it just wouldn’t be our favorite fandom if people weren’t busy yelling at James Gunn over sins he hasn’t committed yet. Fans are furious over the director’s treatment of a character that he hasn’t even laid his hands on. In a beautiful turn of events, it seems like the official DC Twitter account is weighing in on the kerfuffle, and has given definitive proof on where Batman stands on potty humor. With Michael Keaton’s return looming on the horizon, The Bat is weighing heavily on fan’s minds. Plenty of fans have taken to social media to try and determine which directors did the Dark Knight dirty, and who best brought Batman’s villainous counterpart to life.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>Grant Gustin proves once and for all his Flash is superior</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/The_Flash_Barry_Allen_The_CW_DC.jpg><p data-characters=892 data-current-count=1192 data-injectable=true>The ninth episode of Titans season four aired on HBO Max this week, and fans were quick to applaud CW star Grant Gustin’s portrayal of the Scarlet Speedster. Without spoiling too much of the episode, Gustin’s Flash makes a brief appearance in an omniverse crossover event and showcases some seriously impressive moves. Fans were <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">quick to cheer for The Flash</a>, and declare Gustin’s version the more powerful of the two. The brief moment reaffirmed fan belief that Gustin’s Flash is superior, and with nearly a decades worth of growth since his debut in 2014 there’s little wonder why. It’s cannon that Miller’s adaptation of the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">character took inspiration</a> from Gustin’s during the Crisis on Infinite Earth crossover even, and the latest inclusion has fans yet again wondering why DC executives stiffed Gustin while the actor was beautifully portraying the beloved character.</p><p data-characters=380 data-current-count=380 data-injectable=false>With news that The Flash is yet <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">again undergoing reshoots</a> in an effort to pack as many cameos into the ending as possible, its hard to deny fans have every right to be concerned by the swap. The title has been ten years in the making, and though there are several celebrities who are loudly backing the film, it just wouldn’t be DC if the movie delivered everything it promised.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>James Gunn detractors need to realize comic books are actually ridiculous</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Batman-The-Animated-Series-Joker-Wig.jpg><p data-characters=702 data-current-count=702 data-injectable=true>James Gunn really can’t catch a break from DC fans. The director has been fielding ridiculous attacks since he was announced as co-CEO back in November 2022. The hits just keep coming with large swaths of detractors <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">claiming the director</a> won’t do certain characters justice due to his infantile sense of humor. It seems that some adult fans need to actually pick up a comic book every once in a while, or maybe revisit some of the Batman: Animated Series episodes that defined the Dark Knight for so many. The official DC account shared a Tweet the other day, showcasing <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">just how ludicrous</a> the Batman can be, by allowing the lady-unlike Harley Quinn to rip a nasty one in the back of the Batmobile.</p><p data-characters=143 data-current-count=143 data-injectable=false>We hope that the trip down memory lane can help some fans find a little Zen and remember why we love the escapism of comics in the first place.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-don-t-call-it-a-comeback-he-s-been-here-for-years data-injectable=false>Don’t call it a comeback, he’s been here for years</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/batman-michael-keaton-the-flash.jpg><p data-characters=843 data-current-count=843 data-injectable=false>Speaking of Batman, the DC staple has had so many iterations it’s hard to keep track. The character has been a part of pop-culture since the 1940s and has released at least one series every few years since the first run dropped before the beginning of WWII. While the campy 1960s incarnation holds a dear place in many fans’ hearts, most go to bat for Christopher Nolan or Matt Reeves reinventions of the characters. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Redditors engaged in</a> the battle of the bats for quite sometime before one brave soul took to the site to remind fans that the angsty loner now synonymous with the Dark Knight was a narrative first pushed by none other than Tim Burton. Now is the perfect time to reorient fan’s brains towards the ‘90s offerings, with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Michael Keaton reprising</a> his now iconic role as Batman late this spring when The Flash hits theatres.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3ytrdOeqq1llJh6r7HWrGStoaSWu7R5wpqknqddp7ykt9Jmq6GdXaLCrcDIr5yrq5VirrR5wqikoptdl7ywt4ympq%2BhlWKzorrSZp2oqpeawW60zrBkn62eYsGpsYyspq6qk5p6rq3TnqmimZxisKK6jJucaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kelly-carlson-biography-age-wiki-height-weight-boyfriend-family-more.html><span>←</span><span>Kelly Carlson Biography, Age, Wiki, Height, Weight, Boyfriend, Family &amp;amp; More</span></a>
