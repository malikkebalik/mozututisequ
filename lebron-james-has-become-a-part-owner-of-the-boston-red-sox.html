The precise financial details of the investment aren't public knowledge, but James and Carter are now part of a large family of investors with stakes in the company, and in a statement to the press James spoke enthusiastically of the development:</p><p><strong>"For me and for my partner Maverick [Carter] to be the first two Black men to be a part of that ownership group in the history of that franchise — I think it's pretty damn cool."</strong></p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-317685 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/GettyImages-480689826-1.jpg alt width=900 height=704 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-317685 class=wp-caption-text>Theo Wargo/NBC/Getty Images</p><p>James's role with the Red Sox both in public and in the boardroom remains to be seen, but it makes sense that someone with his public stature would want his involvement to be as forward-facing as possible. That might prove a little complicated, since James is famously a fan of other ball teams like, the LA Dodgers and the Cleveland Indians, and, most troublingly for Red Sox fans, their hated New York Yankees.</p><p>That's not to mention how crowded James's plate is already, between his time on the court, his myriad other business ventures, and his upcoming feature film debut in the "Space Jam" sequel. But with so much experience at juggling so many responsibilities at once, it's safe to say he'll be more than ready to handle one more.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue8Crq6KbnJrAcK%2FEpZybqpmpxnC4xJupqKZdn66usdJmn5qrXZeypLvMnmSaZaCWv7V5zrClnqpdpLNuwMeeZJuno6m8r3nRnptmq5%2BtfA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./justice-smith-wiki-age-height-weight-net-worth-boyfriend-family-more.html><span>←</span><span>Justice Smith Wiki, Age, Height, Weight, Net Worth, Boyfriend, Family &amp;amp; More</span></a>
