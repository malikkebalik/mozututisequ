The season 14 bride refused to have anything to do with her husband Chris, leading him to <a href=#>ask for a divorce shortly after their honeymoon</a>. Her behavior was a massive turn-off for viewers, earned her criticism from the show’s experts, and also failed to impress several people who had first-hand experience with the <a href=#>Lifetime</a> reality series.&nbsp;</p><h2>‘Married at First Sight’ alums weigh in on Alyssa and Chris</h2><p id=par-3_73>Several Married at First Sight alums recently sat down with host Donna Rizzo for the Decision Day Dish episode, which aired May 4 on Lifetime. They shared their thoughts on which season 14 couples would stay together and who would split, and they weren’t always on the same page with their prediction. But there was one thing everyone could agree on: Alyssa didn’t come off well during her brief time on the show.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-4_44>“She was close-minded coming into this,” AJ, who married Steph on Married at First Sight Season 8, said. “She expected it [to be] like a fast-food restaurant. Go in, order off the menu, and get your exact meal. And that’s the not the case.”&nbsp;</p><p id=par-5_9><a href=#>Meka from Married at First Sight</a> Season 10 agreed.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-6_38>“She wanted the perfect man,” she said. “And us in MAFS world know that doesn’t exist … in general, you’re never going to get your perfect match. I think that’s what she wanted. And that’s just not realistic.”&nbsp;</p><h2>Paige from ‘Married at First Sight’ Season 12 said she wished she’d acted like Chris from season 14</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-2></figure><p id=par-7_103>Everyone in the group appeared to agree that Chris made the right choice when <a href=#>he asked Alyssa for a divorce</a> shortly after they returned from their tension-filled Puerto Rican honeymoon. At that point, Alyssa had made it clear she had no interest in being married to the man the experts matched her with. However, she was unwilling to say she wanted a divorce, instead insisting that she wanted the “experience” of being on the show – even though she also refused to move in with her husband. During a 1-on-1 meeting with Pastor Cal Roberson, Chris announced he wanted out of the marriage.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-8_25>“She wouldn’t even talk to him,” Kristine from season 8 said. “She wouldn’t spend five minutes with her husband just to have a regular conversation.”&nbsp;</p><p id=par-9_34>Paige – who endured a difficult marriage to a different Chris in Married at First Sight Season 12 – said she agreed “100%” with Chris’ decision to walk away from his marriage to Alyssa.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-10_9>“I probably should have [done] a Chris,” she admitted.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-paige-reflects-on-her-difficult-decision-day-experience>Paige reflects on her difficult Decision Day experience&nbsp;</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-3></figure><p id=par-11_68>Later, Paige reflected on her own Decision Day experience. Going into the episode, it seemed clear to everyone involved that she and Chris needed to divorce, especially after his revelation that his ex was pregnant with his child. But at the last-minute, he flip-flopped. He revealed that his former girlfriend had experienced a miscarriage and that he regretted not giving his marriage with Paige more of a chance.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-12_11>At first, Paige seemed to waffle. But the experts were appalled.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-13_37>“I’m not OK with this,” <a href=#>Dr. Viviana Coles told Chris</a>. “‘I’m being very honest with you. I feel like you’re doing this to play with her and now to play with us. She deserves a lot more.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p id=par-14_5>Ultimately, Paige opted for divorce.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-15_41>“I went in there just trying to check a box, but honestly, I wish we never had to do that,” she said on the Decision Day Dish episode. “Because it just over-complicated something that was very clear really from day 1.”&nbsp;</p><p id=par-16_20>The Married at First Sight Season 14 Decision Day episode airs Wednesday, May 11 at 8 p.m. ET on Lifetime.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-17_7>Check out <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Showbiz Cheat Sheet</a> on Facebook!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS6or7RopydZZGpeqe10ayrZquZnLW1ecClrKarXai5ormMmqOyq6OWwG7A0Z6YraWVo8Fur8eroKxlo5qutLvNZmhtZpipuq17</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-was-the-artist-s-net-worth-at-the-time-of-his-death.html><span>←</span><span>What Was the Artist's Net Worth at the Time of His Death?</span></a>
