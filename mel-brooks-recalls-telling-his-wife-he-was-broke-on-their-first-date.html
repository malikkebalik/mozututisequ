We were at a Chinese restaurant one night, and I said, ‘I’m broke.’ She slipped me a $20 bill under the table. And the bill came up to $14 or $15. It wasn’t that expensive.”</p><p id=par-4_33>Brooks continues, “So, I gave the waiter a $20 bill, and I said, ‘Keep it.’ I got outside and [Anne slapped me].
