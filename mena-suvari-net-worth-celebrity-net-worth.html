The pair divorced five years later, citing irreconcilable differences.</p><p>Subsequently, Suvari began dating concert promoter Simone Sestito. They married in 2010, and divorced in 2012, also citing irreconcilable differences. According to the paperwork filed by Sestito amid their divorce, Sestito was way in the red on both his personal and business-related accounts, and had to resort to credit cards and loans from his parents to pay off his bills. As part of his divorce litigation, he requested a little over $17,000 a month, plus an additional $10,000 for the legal fees he accrued in the divorce. He says that Suvari had an annual income of about $750,000 a year, and that the income disparity in light of their divorce means he's entitled to that healthy monthly sum. Sestino claimed that Mena had just recently earned $225,000 for appearing in a Captain Morgan ad. Mena would later claim in her autobiography that Simone "bled her financially" and was physical during arguments.</p><p>In 2018, Suvari married set decorator Michael Hope, with whom she had a son in April of 2021.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-188133 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/GettyImages-83270062.jpg alt width=594 height=416 sizes="(max-width: 594px) 100vw, 594px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-188133 class=wp-caption-text>Michael Buckner/Getty Images</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue9GimqGdo6l6pLHLnpmroaSesrR7wJyrqKqjZLqmusBmqq6ukae2brrErWSwp6KptXA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./massey-ferguson-1130-hp-price-specs-review-serial-numbers-2022.html><span>←</span><span>Massey Ferguson 1130 HP, Price, Specs, Review, Serial Numbers 2022</span></a>
