She has a close relationship with <a href=#>her godmother, Dolly Parton</a>, and has also bonded with her “Edge of Midnight” collaborator, Stevie Nicks.</p><p id=par-3_94>In 2020, Cyrus revealed on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Howard Stern Show</a> that Parton and Nicks make the same sweet gesture. “The coolest thing, I think, about Stevie, and then even Dolly Parton, who’s my godmother, is even though it’s in a email form, they write me handwritten letters. Like, every letter that I get from Stevie is handwritten, what I get from Dolly is written and signed,” she shared. “It’s a different amount of time that someone takes. It’s not just like, hey, I’m gonna shoot a text and let you know I’m thinking about you.”</p><p id=par-4_24>Cyrus added, “They really, when you write things down, and you give words those kind of power and they say, we’re rooting for you.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-miley-cyrus-previously-revealed-that-dolly-parton-communicates-with-her-via-fax>Miley Cyrus previously revealed that Dolly Parton communicates with her via fax</h2><p id=par-5_44>Although Stevie Nicks and Dolly Parton both send Miley Cyrus handwritten letters, the <a href=#>Hannah Montana star</a> said Parton’s notes often come through the fax machine. During a May 2022 appearance on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Late Night with Seth Myers</a>, Cyrus explained <a href=#>how she and her godmother communicate</a>.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-6_44>“Every time I coordinate or communicate with Dolly, it’s still through fax,” she said. “She does a fax, and then someone scans the fax, and then they put it into a text message, and then that gets sent to me. And it’s always signed.”</p><p id=par-7_31>Cyrus again pointed out the difference in the “connection” that comes with a handwritten letter, noting that it’s “not casual” and that Parton “took the time” to do that for her.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-stevie-nicks-collaborated-with-the-former-disney-star-on-the-song-edge-of-midnight>Stevie Nicks collaborated with the former Disney star on the song ‘Edge of Midnight’</h2><p id=par-8_15>In 2020, Miley Cyrus released “Edge of Midnight,” which samples Stevie Nicks’ <a href=#>“Edge of Seventeen.”</a></p><p id=par-9_33>The former Disney star revealed that she had contacted Nicks for permission to use her 1981 song as inspiration. Their correspondence went so well that Cyrus asked the Fleetwood Mac singer to collaborate.</p><p id=par-10_52>“I had sampled ‘Edge of Seventeen’ and reached out to Stevie, and asked her to bless it, and she said, ‘You can borrow from me any time,’” Cyrus said on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Howard Stern Show</a>. “And so I’m like, ‘S***, if you’re feeling that way, can I just borrow you and your time?’”</p><p id=par-11_28>Nicks opened up about her relationship with Cyrus on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Zane Lowe Interview Series</a> podcast, revealing that she and the <a href=#>“Wrecking Ball” singer</a> had a lot in common.</p><p id=par-12_59>“Miley and I, I didn’t really know Miley until we went into the ‘Edge of Midnight,’ ‘Edge of Seventeen’ thing. And then, we had so many phone conversations,” the Fleetwood Mac singer said. “And we’re both so loud and so talkative that we just went a million miles during our first phone conversation. And we just hit it off.”</p><p id=par-13_18>She added, “And it was super fun. And when it was done, I thought it was really excellent.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS6qrjEsmScsaKqwG6%2BxK%2BcmqSjYrGwuMuyZKmZoqm8r3nAp5tmq6Saw6qxjKegnKOjYrqit8RmqrCdlal6qLHSrayrnV6dwa64jg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jan-berenstain-biography-age-height-husband-net-worth-family.html><span>←</span><span>Jan Berenstain Biography, Age, Height, Husband, Net Worth, Family</span></a>
