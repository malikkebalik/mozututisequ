He was nicknamed "Wild Thing" during his career and is a former relief pitcher. He is currently taking a leave of absence and is working as a studio analyst for the MLB Network. Mitchell Stevens Williams was born in 1964 in Santa Ana, California. He was drafted out of high school in West Linn, Oregon by the San Diego Padres in 1982. The Texas Rangers acquired him in 1985, and he made his major league debut for the team the following year. The Rangers traded him to the Cubs in the 1988 season.</p><p>In 1991, the Cubs dealt Williams to the Phillies, and during that year he won 12 games. He is a left-hander who was largely effective as a pitcher, but is sadly best known for giving up a walk-off home run to <a href=# title="Joe Carter Net Worth">Joe Carter</a> of the Toronto Blue Jays that resulted in Toronto winning the 1993 World Championship over the Phillies. Despite having the highest number of lefty saves in his career with the Phillies, the World Series loss was the end of the road for Williams with the Phillies and the team traded him to the Houston Astros. He closed out his career with the California Angels in 1995, and the Kansas City Royals in 1997. In 2007, Williams joined the Philadelphia radio station, 610 WIP AM as a part-time co-host of the show <a href=# title="Angelo Cataldi Net Worth">Angelo Cataldi</a> and The Morning Team, followed by a stint on Comcast SportsNet as a post-game analyst for Phillies games. In 2009, Williams joined MLB Network as a studio analyst where he is a regular on the network's MLB Tonight program. Williams also serves as a color commentator for Fox Sports occasionally commentating national games.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue9GimqGdo6l6osDHpZytnaNkv6qvx56qrWWSlsCmrsClo2ilmamwqXnWoqOloZGiwG66xK1ksKeiqbVw</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./how-tall-is-dr-disrespect-dr-disrespect-s-height-confirmed.html><span>←</span><span>How tall is Dr. Disrespect?
