Jimmy Fallon hosted SNL with Justin Timberlake as a co-host/ musical guest/ wingman this weekend and it was a holiday treat for all. Saturday's episode featured a handful of quality, really funny sketches that marginally redeemed what was a (pardon the pun) sketchy year for SNL, especially re: the conspicuous White-Maleness of their cast.

Nimona has had a bit of a struggle in getting to us, but hopefully, all that stress will make its imminent release all the sweeter.
