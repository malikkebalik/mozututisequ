Pauly Shore is most famous for his comedic roles in films such as "Encino Man" (1992), "Son in Law" (1993), and "In the Army Now" (1994), but he is also a stand-up comic, director, producer, and podcaster. Pauly's 2014 mockumentary, "Pauly Shore Stands Alone," won the award for Best Documentary at the Downtown Film Festival Los Angeles, and he has hosted the podcasts "Pauly Shore Podcast Show" and "Pauly Shore's Random Rants." Shore's family has owned West Hollywood's world-famous Comedy Store since the early 1970s.</p><h2 id=early-life><strong>Early Life</strong></h2><p>Pauly Shore was born Paul Montgomery Shore on February 1, 1968, in Los Angeles, California. His parents, <a href=#>Mitzi Shore</a> and Sammy (a comedian), opened The Comedy Store in 1972; when Mitzi and Sammy ended their marriage in 1974, she became the sole owner. (Pauly began managing the club after Mitzi's death in 2018.) Shore grew up with 3 siblings, Peter, Scott, and Sandi, in a Jewish household, and he graduated from Beverly Hills High School in 1986. He spent much of his youth around comedians, and at age 17, he performed his first stand-up set at Culver City's Alley Cat Bistro. <a href=#>Sam Kinison</a> became his mentor and let Pauly serve as his opening act many times. While touring as a stand-up comic, Shore developed an alter ego known as "The Weasel" where he played the part of a surfer dude.</p><h2 id=career><strong>Career</strong></h2><p>Pauly got his big break when he landed a job as an MTV VJ in 1989. He kept the VJ position until 1994, hosting "MTV Spring Break" and appearing on the "MTV Video Music Awards." MTV gave Shore his own show, "Totally Pauly, " in 1990, and it ran for 6 years. In 1991, he released his first comedy album, "The Future of America," and made a music video for the track "Lisa, Lisa, the One I Adore." Pauly went on to release 2 more albums: 1992's "Scraps from the Future" and 1994's "Pink Diggily Diggily."</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-303037 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Pauly-Shore-1.jpg alt width=900 height=598 sizes="(max-width: 1256px) 100vw, 1256px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-303037 class=wp-caption-text>(Photo by Brad Barket/Getty Images)</p><p>Shore made his television debut on a 1987 episode of "21 Jump Street" and his big screen debut in 1988's "For Keeps?," which starred <a href=# title="Molly Ringwald Net Worth">Molly Ringwald</a>. In 1992, Pauly starred in "Encino Man" with <a href=# title="Brendan Fraser Net Worth">Brendan Fraser</a> and <a href=# title="Sean Astin Net Worth">Sean Astin</a>; the movie was a hit, earning $40.7 million against a $7 million budget. He followed "Encino Man" with "Son in Law" (1993), which grossed $36.4 million and "In the Army Now" (1994), which grossed $28.8 million. "Jury Duty" (1995) was considered a flop, earning $4 million less than the film's $21 million budget, and 1996's "Bio-Dome" grossed $13.4 million against a production budget of $8.5 million. The Fox network gave Pauly a show, simply called "Pauly," in 1997, but only 5 episodes aired before it was cancelled. Shore has played himself on "Entourage" (2005 and 2007), "Workaholics" (2016), and "Alone Together" (2018).</p><p>Pauly wrote, directed, produced, and starred in the 2003 mockumentary "Pauly Shore Is Dead." Though it grossed just $11,000 during its limited release, it is Shore's most positively reviewed film and earned him an Audience Choice Award for directing at the Slamdunk Film Festival. In 2005, he starred on TBS reality series "Minding the Store," and he wrote, directed, produced, and starred in 2009 mockumentary "Adopted." Pauly also directed and produced the comedy specials "Vegas is My Oyster" (2011) and "Pauly-Tics" (2012).</p><h2 id=personal-life><strong>Personal Life</strong></h2><p>Pauly Shore dated "Son in Law" co-star <a href=#>Tiffani Thiessen</a> and "Bio-Dome" co-star <a href=# title="Kylie Minogue Net Worth">Kylie Minogue</a> in the 1990s. He also had relationships with adult film stars Jewel De'Nyle (2002) and Savannah (1991 – 1992); Savannah, whose real name was Shannon Wilsey, sadly died by suicide in 1994, and Pauly was with her when she passed away at Burbank's St. Joseph's Hospital.</p><h2 id=real-estate><strong>Real Estate</strong></h2><p>In 1996, Shore paid $1.5 million for a 4,500 square foot home in the Hollywood Hills. He renovated the house in 2015 and put it on the market for $13 million; he couldn't find a buyer, so he listed it for rent for $27,000 per month. In 2020, he put the mansion back on the market, this time for an asking price of $9.5 million.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue9GimqGdo6l6pLHLnpmroaSesrR70aKaoZ2jqXqku8yem6KZnqh8sa3UpbBmq5ikv6Z5zZ6rZq%2Bfp8Gpew%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./law-order-svu-premiere-recap-11-12-20-season-22-episode-1-guardians-and-gladiators.html><span>←</span><span>Law &amp;amp; Order SVU Premiere Recap 11/12/20: Season 22 Episode 1 Guardians and Gladiators</span></a>
