If this deal gets finalized, he'll have made more than 10 times the return on his initial investment.</span></p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-286603 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/GettyImages-1033377666.jpg alt width=900 height=669 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-286603 class=wp-caption-text>Ed Zurga/Getty Images</p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Sherman currently owns a minority stake in the Cleveland Indians. He first invested with the Indians in 2016 and his since purchased a larger stake of the team. To ensure this deal happens, Sherman would divest himself of his share of the Indians.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>This is the second sale of an MLB team in the past two years. A group led by Bruce Sherman and <a href=# rel=noopener>Derek Jeter</a> purchased the Miami Marlins for $1.2 billion in the fall of 2017.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>The 84-year-old Glass is the former CEO of Walmart. He was often criticized for not spending enough on his team before their string of success in the middle of the decade. The Royals reached the World Series in 2014 before finally winning the following year. It was their second title in franchise history.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>The sale may become final right around the same time the Royals partner with Fox Sports. That TV deal would reportedly pay the club about $50 million per year for at least a decade. The amount is more than double its current TV rights fee for the Kansas City market.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>It doesn't matter that it's been disastrous since the World Series win. The Royals are just the latest example of the lucrative nature of professional sports.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue8Crq6KbnJrAcL%2FPqKmtq12jsri%2Fjq2fnmWblru0rdJmmqKsqWK%2FsMXApapmmaKaeqOxyKeeZqufobFutMSrnKxlmKTEbrnUnJ9mrJiaxrOxjKCmoqaXYrOwvo4%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./quarterback-josh-allen-or-his-girlfriend-hailee-steinfeld.html><span>←</span><span>Quarterback Josh Allen or His Girlfriend Hailee Steinfeld?</span></a>
