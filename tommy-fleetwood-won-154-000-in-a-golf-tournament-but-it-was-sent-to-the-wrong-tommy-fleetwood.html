Still, 12th place was good enough for a $154,480 check.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Except the European Tour sent the money to a different Tommy Fleetwood.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Tommy Fleetwood, the golfer, is British and plays on the European Tour. Tom Fleetwood, the man who received the money, is American and teaches golf in Florida.</span></p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-266277 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/GettyImages-1014409512.jpg alt width=900 height=600 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-266277 class=wp-caption-text>Richard Heathcote/Getty Images</p><p><span style=font-weight:400>However, Tom Fleetwood had previously competed in Challenge Tour events in Europe. His information was on file with the PGA and European Tour. And thanks to a "clerical error," he briefly can say he's won more than $150,000 from a golf tournament.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>The teacher's friend, Greg Thorner, was present when his buddy noticed the error. Thorner tweeted a photo of the bank account with the winnings. After getting on the phone with his bank, the American Fleetwood was able to get everything sorted out.</span></p><p lang=en dir=ltr>No joke, a friend received Tommy Fleetwood's Open Championship winnings in his bank account last weekend!! They have the same name and he was a PGA pro but still, how does this happen? Didn't believe him until I saw it…good thing he is an honest guy! <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/bE534xfYDV</a></p><p>— #Break30 Golf Short Game School (@GregThornerGolf) <a href=#>August 8, 2018</a></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>As Thorner said in his tweet, luckily his pal is an honest guy. The European Fleetwood is still on tour and hasn't been paying much attention to his winnings.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>"I wouldn't even know if I'd been paid or not because I don't really look," he said. "It looks pretty genuine and they are looking into it, and I'm sure they'll feel pretty bad about it. It's a funny story."</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Fleetwood's money eventually made it to the right place, so this story has a happy ending. But it's a good reminder to routinely check your bank account – especially if you're expecting a six-figure deposit.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue8Crq6KbnJrAcL%2FPqKmtq12jsri%2Fjq2mpqWpYrOtscStrqinlGLEsLqMamxtaGBleqq6jJpkoKecm3q1u9SrpZqllaPBbq7UrWSirF2srrR50p6lrWWkpHq1tMRmrqunnpx6tbvMprBmnpyasrXDzqibaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./lebron-james-has-become-a-part-owner-of-the-boston-red-sox.html><span>←</span><span>LeBron James Has Become A Part-Owner Of The Boston Red Sox</span></a>
