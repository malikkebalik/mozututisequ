However, they continue to prove to the public that they’re as strong as ever. The <a href=#>Kansas City Chiefs tight end is smitten</a> with the pop sensation, and he recently discussed their relationship while on a podcast. Here’s what he said about taking their relationship into the public eye and how he might’ve thrown shade at Swift’s ex, Joe Alwyn.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-travis-kelce-says-he-s-not-afraid-to-show-off-his-public-relationship-with-taylor-swift>Travis Kelce says he’s not afraid to show off his public relationship with Taylor Swift</h2><p id=par-2_45>Taylor Swift is the biggest pop star in 2024. “The Eras Tour” is the highest-grossing music tour in history, surpassing $1 billion in revenue. She’ll continue the tour through Europe until December 2024 — and <a href=#>Travis Kelce couldn’t be prouder</a> to call Swift his girlfriend.</p><p id=par-3_32>Kelce appeared on the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Bussin’ With The Boys</a> podcast in June 2024 to discuss his career and love life. He explained that he and Swift kept their relationship private in the beginning.</p><p id=par-4_26>“But once she came to a game, obviously … it was all poppin’ from there,” Kelce said, referencing <a href=#>Swift attending a Kansas City Chiefs NFL game</a>.</p><p id=par-5_96>For Kelce, privacy isn’t paramount to keeping his romance with Swift work. “You want to keep things private, but at the same time, I’m not here to hide anything,” he said. “That’s my girl, you know what I mean? That’s my lady. So, it’s like, I’m proud of that. I’m not sitting here trying to juggle, like, ‘How can I keep this under wraps,’ you know what I mean? We just don’t want to let everybody into your personal life and be able to comment on it knowing that everything she does is getting a headline.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-did-travis-kelce-slyly-shade-joe-alwyn>Did Travis Kelce slyly shade Joe Alwyn?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Travis-Kelce-Taylor-Swift-3.jpg><p id=par-6_48>Travis Kelce isn’t afraid to show public support for Taylor Swift. The Chiefs tight end’s public displays of affection are much different from how Joe Alwyn treated his relationship with Swift. While Kelce happily discusses his romance, Alwyn found it important to keep his and Swift’s relationship private.</p><p id=par-7_62>“It’s not really [because I] want to be guarded and private; it’s more a response to something else,” Alwyn told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Elle</a> about why he and Swift kept their romance on the down low. “We live in a culture that is so increasingly intrusive … the more you give — and frankly, even if you don’t give it — something will be taken.”</p><p id=par-8_51><a href=#>Alwyn and Swift dated for six years</a> and broke up due to differences in their personalities. “Joe has struggled with Taylor’s level of fame and the attention from the public,” a source told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">People</a>. “The differences in their personalities have also become harder to ignore after years together. They’ve grown apart.”</p><p id=par-9_51>So, was Kelce throwing shade at Alwyn while discussing his relationship on the Bussin’ With The Boys podcast? While the NFL player pointed out that he doesn’t mind the public attention, it’s unclear whether he’s directing shade at Alwyn. However, some Swifties might think Kelce aimed to shame the British actor.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-taylor-swift-said-she-swooned-after-her-boyfriend-made-an-on-stage-appearance-during-the-eras-tour>Taylor Swift said she ‘swooned’ after her boyfriend made an on-stage appearance during ‘The Eras Tour’</h2><p id=par-10_51>Travis Kelce joined Taylor Swift during a London “Eras Tour” show for her performance of “I Can Do It With a Broken Heart.” During Kelce’s appearance, he held Swift in his arms and put her on a red couch. Fans went absolutely wild over the NFL player’s surprise appearance on stage.</p><p id=par-11_13>Swift said she was “still cracking up” and “swooning” over Kelce’s debut.</p><p id=par-12_37>“And I’m still cracking up/swooning over @killatrav’s Eras Tou debut,” she captioned an <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram</a> post from the show. “Never going to forget these shows. Can’t wait to do it five more times in August.
