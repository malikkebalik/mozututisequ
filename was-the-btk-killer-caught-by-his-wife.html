Rader was known for taunting the detectives and communicating directly with the media, going so far as to provide the name BTK (bind, torture, kill) for himself."><meta name=author content="Larita Shotwell"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

Rader brutally murdered at least ten people between 1974 and 1991, all the while maintaining an image as a loving father and church leader.</p><p data-characters=416 data-current-count=647 data-injectable=true>Rader was known for taunting the detectives and communicating directly with the media, going so far as to provide the name BTK (bind, torture, kill) for himself. He also posted awful poems that threatened the lead investigator on his case and left packages containing dolls bound in creepy positions. All of which means Rader was apparently doing his best to be a cliche serial killer from a 1990s police procedural.</p><p data-characters=167 data-current-count=167 data-injectable=false>Rader was finally captured in February 2005, but if you’re here you’re wondering about his wife’s involvement. So, did she play a part in his arrest?</p><h2 id=h-did-btk-s-wife-help-assist-in-his-capture data-injectable=false>Did BTK’s wife help assist in his capture?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/GettyImages-53439066.jpg><p data-characters=438 data-current-count=438 data-injectable=true>Rader’s eventual capture is one of the all-time dumbest moments in the history of true crime. Wanting to further taunt police, he sent them a letter asking them if they would be able to trace a floppy disk and requested that their answer “be honest”. The police responded via a newspaper ad, assuring him that there was absolutely no way they would ever be able to trace a floppy disk. Completely impossible. Definitely.</p><p data-characters=218 data-current-count=218 data-injectable=false>Rader <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">promptly sent them a floppy disk</a> containing more weird ramblings, and about five minutes later investigators found metadata on it naming the church he attended and a document last edited by “Dennis”.</p><p data-characters=131 data-current-count=349 data-injectable=false>Rader is now aged 78 and behind bars in solitary confinement, where he will remain for the rest of his (hopefully miserable) life.</p><p data-characters=464 data-current-count=813 data-injectable=true>You will have noticed that Rader’s wife, Paula Dietz, was not mentioned in that story. She had no idea her husband was one of the most evil serial killers in American history until the day he was arrested and played no part in his capture. In fact, unable to believe that her apparently kind and caring husband could do what he was being accused of, she described him soon after his arrest as “a good man, a great father. He would never hurt anyone.”</p><p data-characters=337 data-current-count=337 data-injectable=false>Paula immediately severed contact after he confessed to his murders. She was then granted an emergency divorce, which was approved by the court the very same day she applied for it. Since then she has never visited him in prison or written him a letter. Nothing is known about her current life, though <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">her daughter Kerri Rawson has said</a>:</p><p>“[My mother]’s sort of dealt with my dad like he died on the day he was arrested… As far as I understand, she has PTSD from the events around his arrest.”</p><p data-characters=57 data-current-count=57 data-injectable=false>Tim Relph, one of the detectives on the case <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">simply said</a>:</p><p>“Paula is a good and decent person… She’s been downplayed by some people as some sort of ignorant Christian person. But her only mistake in life was to care for Dennis Rader.”</p><p data-characters=280 data-current-count=523 data-injectable=true>Rader’s daughter Kerri Rawson has maintained a correspondence with her father and says she’s forgiven him, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">though admits</a> “It’s a very lonely, the worst club you could ever imagine belonging to, being the daughter of a serial killer.” We can only imagine.</p><p data-characters=133 data-current-count=133 data-injectable=false>If you know someone suffering from sexual violence, contact&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">RAINN</a>&nbsp;or the National Sexual Abuse Telephone Hotline at 1-800-656-4673.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekp8KmecKroKadX6yutHnToZxmmqSgeqy1y6Wcq2WTlsKotNNmmbJlmJ7AbsPIn5xo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./james-labrie-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>James LaBrie Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</span></a>
