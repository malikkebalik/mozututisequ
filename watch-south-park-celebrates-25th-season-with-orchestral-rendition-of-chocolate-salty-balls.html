Recommended Videos The 45-second clip is short but salty-sweet with a fully decked-out orchestra in tuxedos looking unusually classy when juxtaposed to the raunchy lyrics that include the line, “Suck on my chocolate salty balls.”
It’s especially giggle-worthy to hear the lyrics belted out with the operatic precision of Tamar Greene, who plays George Washington in the current Broadway company of Lin-Manuel Miranda’s hit musical, Hamilton, according to his website."><meta name=author content="Reinaldo Massengill"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>
