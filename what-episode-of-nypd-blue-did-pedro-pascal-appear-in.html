It was a massively praised show, winning over ten Prime Time Emmys and being a regular fixture at all TV award shows. This was because, unlike similar shows at the time,&nbsp;NYPD Blue&nbsp;was grittier and more realistic. Plus, the show spent a lot of time focusing on the characters’ problems in their personal lives and how it affected their work.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=281 data-current-count=281 data-injectable=false>Pascal appeared in the ninth episode of the show’s eighth season, “Oh Golly Goth.” It should be noted that this episode aired in 2001, and at the time, Pascal was a very new actor, having made his TV debut only a few years before in 1999’s&nbsp;Good vs. Evil.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=496 data-current-count=777 data-injectable=true>“Oh Golly Goth” sees the team having to deal with the aftermath of a stabbing. Three goths are implicated in the crime due to being at the same party, forcing the cops to learn about a subculture they know little to nothing about. Pedro Pascal plays Shane ‘Dio’ Morrissey, one of the goths. Pascal is involved in a highly memorable interrogation scene that shows that even in 2001, the actor had a fantastic range and a talent for bringing unusual personalities to life.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-why-are-people-talking-about-pascal-s-nypd-blue-role data-injectable=false>Why are people talking about Pascal’s&nbsp;NYPD Blue&nbsp;role?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=180 data-current-count=480 data-injectable=true>This role is being talked about because Pascal mentioned it during his appearance on the hot-wing-based interview show&nbsp;Hot Ones.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p data-characters=306 data-current-count=306 data-injectable=false>When asked about some of his unique roles, Pascal mentioned his appearance on&nbsp;NYPD Blue.&nbsp;He said: “There was a really, really unusually fun character that I played on NYPD Blue, this goth guy named Dio. And he had all these fake piercings and was just a teenager hitting on the female cop.”&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=766 data-current-count=1072 data-injectable=true>However, what has really caught the internet’s attention is Pascal saying that he made up his own language for the role. He said: “At one point, he has a pentagram on the inside of his palm that they made with a black sharpie, and I lick it, and I make up some Satanic language. I thought it was supposed to be like, Latin or something. And I remember thinking, ‘Do you have Latin words I’m supposed to learn?’ and they’re like ‘No dude, just make it up.’ And I was like, ‘oh, okay.’ It was a kind of thing where I licked the hand, and then I turned slowly toward the camera going,” explains Pascal. He then makes a series of disturbing sounds with his mouth, before quickly snapping back to normal.</p><p data-characters=188 data-current-count=188 data-injectable=false>He then finishes the earlier statement by adding: “some crazy shit like that on an episode of your ABC Network television hit, ‘NYPD Blue.’ I made up the language.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y4tMCtZJ6omai8pbGMqJ1mpqmlsW6uy66cZpyZmXqxscOrpmaokaiworiMmqepnZGneqq6jg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./sheikh-khalifa-bin-zayed-al-nahyan-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Sheikh Khalifa Bin Zayed Al Nahyan Net Worth</span></a>
