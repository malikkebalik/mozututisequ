Clinching her first Tony in 1994 for Carousel, she went on to repeatedly achieve the award for her roles in Master Class, Ragtime, A Raisin in the Sun, and Porgy and Bess. McDonald’s portrayal of Billie Holiday in 2014 earned her the record-breaking total of six Tonys.</p><p id=par-3_27>“I’m just overwhelmed,” McDonald said of the monumental accomplishment in 2014, according to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Playbill</a>. “I don’t know what else to say. I’m grateful and don’t believe it.”&nbsp;</p><p id=par-4_58>A Juilliard graduate with a degree in Classical Voice, McDonald explored other venues of entertainment throughout her professional life. With multiple television and film roles, the Broadway star is renowned in all facets of show business.

I am beyond grateful to [series creator]&nbsp;Shonda Rhimes, ABC, and the team behind the show.”</p><p id=par-8_51>McDonald went on to play a myriad of other television roles, such as U.S. attorney Liz Lawrence in The Good Wife and the spinoff The Good Fight.
