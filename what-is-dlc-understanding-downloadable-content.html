The Sega Dreamcast, one of the first video game consoles that could connect to the internet, had DLC for a few of its major games. DLC became more commonplace upon the release of the Xbox 360, which expanded the availability of extra content through its Xbox Live service. PlayStation and Nintendo followed suit with their respective online services. The rise in popularity of PC gaming on Steam also helped tremendously.</p><p class=premium>Nowadays, as more users buy games digitally instead of on physical discs, DLC is incredibly common. Most big games from major studios (often called AAA games) offer DLC. It's become a major aspect of the gaming industry, and can extend a game's popularity and money-making potential for years.</p><p>Advertisement</p><h2 class=premium><strong>The different types of DLC</strong></h2><p class=premium>There are different kinds of DLC available for all types of games. Some of them affect gameplay and take up a lot of space on your console, while others are hardly noticeable.&nbsp;</p><p class=premium>DLC can include extra stories and levels, new characters, unlockable weapons, bonus items, and more depending on the type of game. DLC can also be cosmetic, changing a character's appearance with a new outfit or modification (these are often referred to as "skins"). Some DLC might just be bug fixes.</p><figure class="figure image-figure-image premium" data-type=img data-e2e-name=image-figure-image data-media-container=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject><a class=image-click-enlarge href=# data-click-enlarge data-credit-href data-component-type=click-to-enlarge rel=nofollow data-analytics-product-module=body_link></a><span class=image-source-caption>An example of downloadable content — in this case, new character outfits — for Nintendo's "Super Smash Bros Ultimate." <span class="image-source headline-regular" data-e2e-name=image-source itemprop=creditText>Nintendo; Sora Ltd.</span></span></figure><p class=premium>Some games offer DLC for free, which you can download from your console's online gaming store. However, it's much more common for companies to charge for DLC, especially if it adds a significant amount of content.</p><p class=premium>Games that have a lot of DLC released over time may offer a package deal called a "season pass." Season passes include all current and future DLC for a given game, usually at a discounted price, so you only need to pay for the game's DLC once even if some of it hasn't been released yet.</p><a id=post-author_profile-link href=# data-analytics-product-module=author-bio rel></a><a id=post-author_name-link class="post-author_link not-content-link" href=# data-analytics-product-module=author-bio rel><p>Chrissy Montelli</p></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o8HSoqWeq6Oeu7S1w56pZ5ufonyowcidnKxnpJqwqXvDpZpmpZWWu6q6xg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./shannon-briggs-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Shannon Briggs Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</span></a>
