Bryant <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> on Meyers’ show her husband’s sweet marriage proposal that went awry, starting with the discovery of her dog wearing a bow tie.</p><p id=par-8_79>“I was like, ‘My dog doesn’t wear a bow tie! Where is he going tonight?,'” she said. “Basically, the second I shut the door, a man — who I discovered was Conner — frantically came around the corner and was just like, ‘Will you marry me?!’ No box, no ‘I love you.’ … Just a man in full terror standing very far from a dog in a bow tie, just holding a loose ring going, ‘Will you marry me?!'”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-shrill-was-a-personal-project-for-bryant>‘Shrill’ was a personal project for Bryant</h2><p id=par-9_46>Bryant was nominated for two 2021 Emmys: for supporting actor in a comedy series for SNL and as lead actor in a comedy series for <a href=#>Hulu’s Shrill</a> in which she portrayed Annie, an overweight young woman eager to transform her life, but not her body.</p><p id=par-10_28>She told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">W</a> in August of her hope to find another project as personal as Shrill, in which she not only starred but also served as a writer.</p><p id=par-11_66>“I don’t know. I’m currently working on other shows that I’m developing, and I guess one is kind of personal,” she said. “But I feel like anything I write is going to be personal in some way, you know?,” she said. “I feel really proud of what we did, and kind of want to leave that there and head on to something a little bit different.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGTEqa3TZpiinKlir7PFwKerrGWemsFuw86rq6FmmKm6rXs%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./pok%C3%A9mon-fan-imagines-how-the-original-starters-could-have-looked.html><span>←</span><span>Pokmon fan imagines how the original starters could have looked</span></a>
