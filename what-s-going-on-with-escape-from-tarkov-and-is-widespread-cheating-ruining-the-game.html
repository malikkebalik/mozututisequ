The political collapse has led to a battle for the streets of the city between two rival security companies, USEC and BEAR.

He installed a series of “wallhacks” which allowed him to peer across the map directly through trees and buildings. Then, when he had another player in his sights, he shimmied his character from right to left and watched the other players do the same in response. gOat estimated that over half the matches he played that session involved one or more cheaters.</p><p data-characters=237 data-current-count=237 data-injectable=false>In response to the viral video, the COO of Battlestate games Nikita Buyanov claimed that the company bans several thousand cheaters a day, and encouraged players to “<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">report all these b******s, we will make the game cleaner together</a>”.</p><p data-characters=143 data-current-count=380 data-injectable=false>Cheating can ruin a multiplayer game for everyone.
