Nevertheless, Quantumania will be his first appearance on the silver screen, and fans are rightfully excited to see what kind of large-scale trouble he will unleash. To get to that point, though, tickets must first be acquired.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania-poster.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-when-can-fans-buy-ant-man-3-tickets data-injectable=false>When can fans buy Ant-Man 3 tickets?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania-kang.jpg><p data-characters=583 data-current-count=883 data-injectable=true>At the time of writing, Marvel has yet to announce the exact date when fans will be able to get their hands on Ant-Man 3 tickets. If we take a look at previous films’ ticket sales, though, we can spot a pattern that might help fans get ready for D-Day. Typically, tickets for Marvel Studios’ movies tend to go on sale a month before the film is released in theaters, give or take a few days. Considering that Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania will premiere globally on Feb. 17, fans should expect tickets to release around mid-January, most likely in the week of Jan. 16.</p><p data-characters=155 data-current-count=155 data-injectable=false>Of course, without word from Marvel, this is merely a prediction, and Ant-Man enthusiasts will have to keep their eyes peeled for an official announcement.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJorqGdnmKxsHnAp6tmpZGjeqK6w2aroZ1drK60vIyqrJqmpKq6orrImmStoZOgsrW%2FjKCmZqeeYsCiuMRo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./tom-schwartz-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Tom Schwartz Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</span></a>
