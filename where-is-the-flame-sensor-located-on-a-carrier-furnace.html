It’s not much more than a thin, usually bent, metallic rod that sits in front of the flame stream inside the furnace. The purpose of the flame sensor is to confirm to the system that whenever the gas valve is open, a fire is actually present.Click to see full answer. Keeping this in consideration, where is the flame sensor located?A furnace flame sensor is a very basic part of your furnace. It’s located on the burner assembly and is just a thin metallic rod. It’s usually bent, and it sits just in front of the pilot flame inside the furnace.Secondly, how do you bypass the flame sensor on a furnace? Actually, you can bypass the flame sensor. the flame sensor is just a way of exposing the voltage on the flame sensor wire to the furnace burner flames. So you can connect the flame sensor wire to a screwdriver and put the screwdriver into the flames. In this manner, how do I know if my furnace flame sensor is bad? Signs of a bad furnace flame sensor are: The furnace lights but then shuts down after a few seconds (short cycles) The porcelain on the flame sensor is cracked. The flame sensor is sooty or corroded. Does every furnace have a flame sensor?Not all furnaces have a flame sensor, but if your furnace has one, it will be mounted close to the burner with the metal rod positioned in the flame. Flame sensors vary in size (2 to 4 inches) and shape (see examples below).</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSesrSu1LOxZ5ufonuotI6wn56qlWK2tHnToZxmnpyWuqZ50p6lrKeiYrmwr8CtnJ1ln6N6onnCmqmroZWneqfB0aeYnJ1f</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jennifer-aniston-admits-she-lost-30-pounds-to-nab-role-on-friends-i-wasn-t-getting-lots-of-j.html><span>←</span><span>Jennifer Aniston Admits She Lost 30 Pounds to Nab Role on 'Friends' -- 'I Wasnt Getting Lots of J</span></a>
