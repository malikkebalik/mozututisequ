They later became the Fugees as a shout-out to Haitian immigrants who were often called refugees.</p><p id=par-3_56>The Fugees dropped their first album, Blunted on Reality in 1994. It showcased their signature style, chemistry, and talent well. Next up was The Score in 1996, which was a game-changer. The certified multiplatinum album included hits like “Fu-Gee-La,” “Ready or Not,” and the remake of the Roberta Flack crowd-pleaser, “Killing Me Softly With His Song.”</p><p id=par-4_50>Critics, fans, and peers praised The Score, which boasts wall-to-wall artistry with no skippable tracks. It’s a 1-hour 17-minute story that is most impactful when consumed in its entirety with no interruptions. With The Score (expanded edition), the Fugees delivered a true music aficionado’s dream. And the trio scored two Grammy Awards to boot.</p><p id=par-5_48>To the dismay of fans, The Fugees disbanded after breaking the mold with The Score. But they continued working in entertainment, concentrating on solo projects, and are still music icons with considerable wealth and fame. Here’s how the former bandmates stack up today, according to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">Celebrity Net Worth</a>.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Lauryn Hill</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Lauryn-Hill.jpg><p id=par-6_44>In 1998, Hill released her solo project, titled The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill. The multiplatinum album outdid the Fugees with seemingly nonstop airplay and five Grammy Awards. MTV Unplugged No. 2.0 came next in 2002. Hill performed beautifully, but sales failed to reach the heights of her debut.</p><p id=par-7_58>Aside from her singing career, Hill has dabbled in acting. Movie buffs may remember her starring opposite Whoopi Goldberg in the 1993 film, Sister Act 2: Back in the Habit. The entertainer has been back on set for a forthcoming big-screen feature called, Man in Wood. With nearly 30 years in show business, Hill has amassed an estimated fortune of $8 million.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Wyclef Jean</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Wyclef-Jean.jpg><p id=par-8_49>After The Score, Jean went on to record seven albums, which sold a combined total of almost 9 million copies, according to Spotify.
