Even closer than he implied in his two facts and a lie is the reality that Chris is Donny’s son. That, as we can see, is the central deception.

Like his famous musician father and extended relatives, he has established himself as a vocalist.</p><p>Chris’s single was published before the Season 2 debut of Claim to Fame, and he goes by his true surname on Instagram, so he isn’t trying to hide his identity.
