Nowadays, she works as an account executive at Jungo, a company based in San Diego, California that “provides financial industry experts with CRM & Marketing solutions from one central login,” according to LinkedIn.</p><p data-characters=383 data-current-count=383 data-injectable=false>Outside of her career, based on Kent’s Instagram profile (where she has amassed nearly 17k followers), it appears that she enjoys attending concerts and music festivals, grabbing drinks with her friends, spending time with her family, and more. In addition to this, Kent also hard at hearing, documenting her decision to get a cochlear implant just last year via social media.</p><p data-characters=751 data-current-count=1134 data-injectable=true>Because of this, the 25-year-old has become an activist for hearing loss by writing a children’s book titled Daisy Doo All The Sounds She Knew, as well as starting her own nonprofit organization called Hear Your Heart. According to LinkedIn, “Hear Your Heart is a nonprofit organization created to help support children who have autoimmune disorders or hearing loss. We help give children medical assistance, funds for future education, and bringing awareness to mental health for children and families. Hear Your Heart believes every child should live their life to their fullest. We are striving to encompass what it truly means to Hear Your Heart, challenging all to listen inward and explore all options.” How incredible is that?</p><p data-characters=337 data-current-count=337 data-injectable=false>Nonetheless, as far as a relationship goes, given that Kent comes from a big, loving family, she is looking for a love like her parents have (which has been over 30 years in the making). Her perfect match is a man that will truly put her first, as well as a man who is loyal, adventurous, family oriented. Hopefully Graziadei is her guy!</p><p data-characters=199 data-current-count=536 data-injectable=false>To watch Daisy Kent fight for the heart of Joey Graziadei, catch the premiere of&nbsp;The Bachelor&nbsp;season 28 on ABC on Monday, January 22.
