We hadn’t seen each other, there was a lack of effort to see each other. I was getting resentful because anytime we did see each other, I felt like I was carrying that load,” she said on the podcast.</p><p id=par-5_70>Ballerini continued, “And I was tired. I was just tired of showing up in that way all the time and not feeling like I was seen or matched. And then I was also tired from, like, traveling all the time and, like, giving so much of myself ’cause that’s what I want to do to honor my career too and I think I just felt really depleted and not understood.”&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><h2 id=h-kelsea-ballerini-thinks-sleeping-on-the-couch-made-her-compartmentalize>Kelsea Ballerini thinks sleeping on the couch made her ‘compartmentalize’</h2><p id=par-6_26>Speaking with Call Her Daddy host Alex Cooper, Ballerini explained that she and Evans did not have huge fights and moved silently around their house.</p><p id=par-7_35>“I definitely learned how to compartmentalize,” Ballerini said. “Because I was like ‘I have to work tomorrow. I have to work tomorrow. And I have to show up with him so people don’t ask questions.'”</p><p id=par-8_16>She continued, “And then you know, 2021 I host the CMT Awards; he just wasn’t there.”</p><p id=par-9_30>Ballerini clarified that she asked Evans not to attend the 2021 CMT Awards so she could focus on working and not be distracted by the problems in their relationship.</p><p id=par-10_25>“We were like in and out of separation and just not good. And I was like, it’s just like, ‘I don’t want to fake it.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p></figure><h2 id=h-what-happened-between-kelsea-ballerini-and-morgan-evans>What happened between Kelsea Ballerini and Morgan Evans?</h2><p id=par-11_22>On the podcast, Ballerini also revealed what it was like when she and Evans realized divorce was the best option for them.</p><p id=par-12_40>“I was just really honest. I was like, ‘I’ve loved what this has brought in my life and I respect you and I respect me and because of that, I can no longer be in this marriage,'” said Ballerini.</p><p id=par-13_20>She continued, “We cried, we hugged. It was sweet. And then something changed and I haven’t talked to him since.”</p><p id=par-14_30>Ballerini is currently romantically linked to Outer Banks actor <a href=#>Chase Stokes</a>, and she confirmed on Call Her Daddy that she is not concerned about Evans’ “feelings” regarding her moving on.</p><p id=par-15_34>“I’m not married to him anymore and I don’t need to care about his feelings anymore. I mean that with all the respect in the world, but his journey is not mine,” she said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGTEqcWMpJylq5WWeqOty6Wcq6Gennq0uMSpq2abn6qwqXnDrqmippditaa%2BjKaYq6qZlrSmecyoqaCZnmKyt63NrGWhrJ2hfA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-is-the-she-hulk-attorney-at-law-release-date-on-disney-plus.html><span>←</span><span>What Is the She-Hulk: Attorney at Law Release Date on Disney Plus?</span></a>
